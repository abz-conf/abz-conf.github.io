        abstract: "This paper presents a sound encoding of B proof obligations in SMT-LIB 2.7, leveraging the recent extensions of SMT-LIB to higher-order logic. Our encoding improves upon previous approaches by eliminating uninterpreted membership predicates and by avoiding the complexity of encoding functions as relations. Through SMT-LIB's support for higher-order constructs, we achieve a more natural representation of B's set theory, while ensuring soundness of the translation. Preliminary experimental results are promising and indicate that our encoding allows solvers to efficiently handle certain proof obligations that previously failed."

        topic: B
        abstract: "In cyber-security, insider threats are particularly challenging to prevent because they are carried out by individuals who already have legitimate access to the information system (IS). In fact, insiders exploit their privileges to perform unauthorized actions. In previous works we proposed to tackle this problem via a backward symbolic search built on a formal B specification of the IS. Unfortunately this approach is not performant because many proof obligations and constraints must be solved interactively. In this paper, we provide a heuristic-based forward search based on the ant colony optimization algorithm (API); that we implemented using ProB. We show how the API algorithm can be used to search for malicious scenarios and we present the results of our experiments in comparison with other approaches."

The first goal of this project concerns the verification of the proofs built with this systems through their translation to the pivot language LambdaPi. The second goal is the exchange of models and proofs between the considered set-based environments (Rodin, TLAPS, Atelier B). In this paper, we present our preliminary work were we translate Event-B models, proof obligations and their proofs to the TLA+ environment. The translation of models has already been studied in [HL16]. Here, we also generate the proof obligations linked to invariant preservation in TLA+. Lastly, we translate proof interactively built using the Rodin platform to the TLA+ proof language."

        abstract: "We develop a behavioural theory of reflective parallel algorithms (RAs), i.e. synchronous parallel algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. The theory comprises a set of postulates defining the class of RAs, an abstract machine model, and the proof that all RAs are captured by this machine model. RAs are sequential-time, parallel algorithms, where every state includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using multiset comprehension terms as values. The model of reflective abstract state machines (rASMs) extends ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state."

        topic: ASM
        abstract: Smart contracts are programs that automate agreements between parties without the need for intermediaries. Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant financial losses. This paper presents an approach to detecting vulnerable aspects of smart contracts written in Solidity and running on the Ethereum blockchain. Starting from an Abstract State Machine (ASM) model of a smart contract, the absence of certain vulnerabilities is expressed as model invariants. Symbolic execution of the ASM model is then used to reveal faulty execution paths resulting in invariant violations. In this way, vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart contract can be generated. As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running case study, the "Auction" smart contract. Furthermore, we discuss the results of applying the technique to a number of Solidity smart contracts.

        topic: B
        abstract: "Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are major engineering and research topics, and ensuring the safety of such a critical system becomes crucial. Nevertheless, ADS are inherently complex, with many of their components, particularly sensors, relying on Artificial Intelligence. In addition to traditional environment data, ADS now processes object recognition outputs. To handle this new type of information, the Bounding Box Specification Language (BBSL) has been formalised to capture the relation between the abstraction of the image with the bounding box and the correct action to be performed. However, this language has a lightweight semantics, leading to multiple interpretations when no tools are available and its semantics remain implicit. In this paper, we propose a framework that fully formalises the language and allows the manipulation of the elements of the language as a first-class citizen in algebraic theory. We introduce three BBSL proof obligations and a mechanism to automatically generate and discharge the proof obligation. We also propose an extension of BBSL by explicitly formalising the semantics and behaviour of external interactions, such as importing information from outside sources. Furthermore, we also propose two instantiation mechanisms, deep-modelling and shallow-modelling, and we use an interpretation of BBSL in an Event-B machine. We demonstrate our approach in an example of BBSL specifications for the braking systems."

        topic: Case Study
        abstract: "This requirements document presents the case study for the ABZ conference 2025. The case study is about a safety controller for autonomous driving on a highway. The description contains two variations of the case study. First, in the simpler setting, we just consider a single- lane highway where each vehicle can accelerate and brake. The goal is to keep a safe distance to the preceding car. Second, we consider a multi-lane highway where each vehicle can also change lanes.<br>The challenge is to model the system and its environment, derive assump- tions, and model a controller that guarantees safety. The challenge is also to present the safety case in such a way that it is convincing to readers not entirely familiar with the formal method employed.<br>The case study is designed so that the formal model can be used as a safety shield within a highway simulation environment. We provide pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents for experimental purposes. This part of the case study is optional."

        topic: Case Study
        abstract: "Mission-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, operate in dynamic environments where unexpected events should be managed while guaranteeing safe behavior. Ensuring the safety of these complex systems is a major open challenge and requires robust mechanisms to enforce correct behavior during runtime. This paper illustrates a run-time safety enforcement framework for the output sanitization of an autonomous driving agent on a highway. The enforcement mechanism is based on a (formally validated and verified) Asmeta model representing the enforcement rules and used at run-time to eventually steer the driving agent to behave safely and avoid collisions. We demonstrate both efficacy and efficiency of the proposed enforcement approach by conducting an experimental evaluation. We connected our safety enforcer with the highway simulation environment and co-executed it with the pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents as provided by the ABZ 2025 case study. We consider the single-lane case with the safety requirement and one scenario of the multi-lane case about preferring the right-most lane."

        topic: Case Study
        abstract: "The Stark tool has been introduced for the the specification, analysis and verification of cyber-physical systems operating under uncertainty. In this paper, we apply it to the modelling and safety analysis of several instances of a highway environment with autonomous vehicles: one vehicle will be controlled by a Stark agent, while the others are modelled as part of a Stark environment. Given the unpredictable behaviour of the environment, we analyse some safety guarantees on the behaviour of the agent in terms of its robustness against perturbations. To this end, we make use of the temporal logic RobTL and statistical model checking. We then discuss the use of Stark for the validation of the behaviour of reinforcement learning agents in the highway environment with the temporal logic DisTL."

        start: "09:00"
        end: "10:00"
        topic: "Keynote"
        abstract: "Rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics pose challenges to conventional methods of safety assurance. Machine learning is a very different programming approach to algorithm design, and notions of correctness for machine learning systems are still evolving. Increasing levels of autonomy being deployed in robotic systems means weaker concepts of control and predictability, increasing risk of accidents, and challenging conventional safety assurance methods. The role of abstraction/refinement formal methods, such as Event-B, is quite well established for traditional safety-critical systems, but it remains an open question whether and how such methods are applicable to systems with autonomy and learning-based control.
<br>Recent ideas on guaranteed safe AI from leading formal methods researchers propose the use of three components to ensure safe AI systems: a safety specification, a world model, and a verifier. At a high level this represents a systems approach to safety analysis which aligns well with common usage of Event-B in conventional system design. Constructing specifications and world (or environment) models for complex systems remains challenging, and abstraction and refinement approaches are aimed at addressing system complexity through incremental modelling and verification. Systematic approaches to analysis of (informal) requirements and of safety hazards also play in important role. We explore how existing work on hierarchical analysis and verification could be extended and relaxed to deal with autonomy and machine learning. The focus is on physical safety rather than broader issues of influences of AI on human behaviours and ethics.<br>The ideas are influenced by collaboration with Asieh Salehi Fathabadi, Colin Snook, Dana Dghaym, Fahad Alotaibi, Haider Al-Shareefy, and Thai Son Hoang."

        abstract: "Concept-based design is a new emerging formalism that uses concepts to facilitate the construction of modular and reusable software. Concepts are independent and generic units of functionality that can be composed to form complex applications. This work presents Conceptual, a domain-specific language for defining and composing concepts. A compiler from this language to Alloy6 is implemented, establishing a way to formally model and validate concept specifications of software. The practical application of Conceptual is examined qualitatively by leveraging Alloy’s analysis tools to reason about existing concept specifications in the literature."

Recent efforts in tool development and teaching of Alloy have contributed the Alloy4Fun dataset enabling many analyses of fine-grained model editing histories. We present a smaller, but complementary dataset of similar editing granularity. While the Alloy4Fun dataset captures users filling in predefined predicates, our dataset is more diverse and users develop all parts of Alloy models including signatures, fields, facts, and commands. We illustrate the differences between the datasets, define a Halstead metric to measure the difficulty of models, and evaluate model revision histories from both datasets on various metrics."

        author: Pedro Silva, Nuno Macedo and José N. Oliveira
        topic: Alloy
        abstract: "A key feature of model finding techniques allows users to enumerate and explore alternative solutions. However, it is challenging to guarantee that the generated instances are relevant to the user, representing effectively different scenarios. This challenge is exacerbated in quantitative modeling, where one must consider both the qualitative, structural part of a model, and the quantitative data on top of it. This results in a search space of possibly infinite candidate solutions, often infinitesimally similar to one another. Thus, research on instance enumeration in qualitative model finding is not directly applicable to the quantitative context, which requires more sophisticated methods to navigate the solution space effectively. The goal of this paper is to explore and showcase different, generic strategies for navigating quantitative solution spaces, aiming to generate instances that differ considerably from those previously seen, ensuring a larger coverage of the search space. Such generic strategies are implemented in QAlloy – a quantitative extension to Alloy – and are evaluated against several examples ranging, in particular, over the integer and fuzzy domains."

        abstract: "SafeCap is a modern toolkit for modelling, simulation and formal verification of railway networks, focused on fully-automated scalable safety verification of solid state interlocking (SSI) programs – a technology at the heart of many railway signalling solutions worldwide. In this paper, we elaborate on the formal foundations of the employed method by presenting the formal proof semantics of the modelled systems and the properties we are interested in verifying. We discuss the composite nature of this semantics, namely, interrelationships between signalling programs, signalling plan data, and the safety principles we need to ensure. The main focus is to formally justify derivation of a number of proof obligations that a specific interlocking solution must satisfy. The semantic definitions, properties, and inference rules are formalised with the proof assistant Coq."

        author: Frederic Reiter, Roman Wetenkamp, Robert Schmid, Richard Kretzschmar and Lukas Iffländer
        topic: Railway, Industry
        abstract: "Specifications for safety-critical railway signaling systems have traditionally been expressed in natural language. Due to a lack of trace- ability features, these requirements are difficult to reason about and thus very resistant to change. Validation and verification processes of cyber- physical components based on such specifications require extensive man- ual review and are prone to inefficiencies. This paper describes our work towards a comprehensive methodology for deriving formal specifications for railway signaling and generating veri- fied software for it. Our method focuses on accessibility for domain ex- perts and industrial applicability. To this effect, we integrate established techniques into a unified tool chain comprising (1) fault tree analysis, (2) the goal-oriented requirements engineering method KAOS, and (3) formal modelling with AdaCore SPARK. We aim to facilitate end-to-end traceability of requirements through all artifacts. Currently, we are ap- plying our methodology to a case study that involves the specification of a new ETCS-based moving block signalling system."

        topic: B
        abstract: "While detection of suspicious or erroneous CPU behaviour can be achieved by generic mechanisms such as memory safe processors, recovering safely from the resulting exceptions is an application specific problem. The challenge is to ensure that a complex closed system including controller and its environment remain in a safe state while undertaking abnormal state changes in the controller as part of its exception recovery process. Handling exceptional error events is a complex task requiring insight and domain expertise to ensure that potential abnormal conditions are identified and a recovery process is designed to return the system to a safe state. Exception handling relies on a notion of transactions in order to identify how the system can be systematically returned to a consistent state. Formal methods can address this complexity, by supporting the analysis of transactions and exception handling at the abstract design stages utilising mathematical modelling and proofs. Event-B is a state-based formal method for modelling and verifying the consistency of discrete systems, however it lacks explicit support for analysing the handling of exceptions. UML-B is a diagrammatic front-end for Event-B modelling which allows models to be constructed using class diagrams and state-machines. In this paper, we use UML-B state machines to support the modelling of normal behaviour, with a notion of consistency and augment this with a technique for modelling 'transactions' which may either complete to reach a consistent state or encounter exceptional errors that have to return the system to a consistent state despite the non-completion of the transaction. We also discuss an implementation of the modelled exception handling in the `C' programming language as a first stage towards automatic code generation of exception handlers."

        topic: Case Study
        abstract: "The ABZ 2025 conference case study focuses on developing a safety controller for autonomous highway driving. Within this context, we present a model of interacting agents that synchronize with a global state at specific points in time. These agents follow the differential equations of standard kinematics, operating within a physical environment. They can make non-deterministic decisions regarding acceleration and follow strategies to avoid collisions. We instantiate our model according to the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) setting. By defining agent properties such as extensions, cycle times, and acceleration limits, we concentrate on the single-lane model specified in the case study requirements document. A key feature of our instantiation is the consideration of agents operating with independent clocks. We demonstrate that the safety invariants defined by RSS still hold even when agents have independent and mutually unknown clocks. This enhances the model’s realism and makes it well-suited for refinement into implementations using synchronous languages such as Lustre and SCADE, enabling the development of safe and certifiable systems for the automotive industry."

        abstract: "While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising approaches for developing intelligent autonomous driving (AD) agents, ensuring the safety of these AI-driven AD systems is a critical challenge. This paper proposes an approach to enhancing AD safety through the development of a safety shield based on online model checking. The safety shield acts as a real-time verification layer, monitoring and validating the actions proposed by the AI agent before execution. We demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our approach through a highway driving case study with different AI agents trained. We construct a formal model of the driving environment, capturing the states and behaviors of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic, and specify the safety requirements within this model. For each proposed action, we leverage Maude’s invariant model checker to determine if executing the action would violate the safety requirements. Our experimental results demonstrate the capability of online model checking to enhance the safety of AI-driven autonomous vehicles."

        topic: Case Study
        abstract: "This article presents a formal model and formal safety proofs for the ABZ’25 case study in differential dynamic logic (dL). The case study considers an autonomous car driving on a highway avoiding collisions with neighbouring cars. Using KeYmaera X’s dL implementation, we prove absence of collision on an infinite time horizon which ensures that safety is preserved independently of trip length. The safety guarantees hold for time-varying reaction time and brake force. Our dL model considers the single lane scenario with cars ahead or behind. We demonstrate that dL with its tools is a rigorous foundation for runtime monitoring, shielding, and neural network verification. Doing so sheds light on inconsistencies between the provided specification and simulation environment highway-env of the ABZ’25 study. We attempt to fix these inconsistencies and uncover numerous counterexamples which also indicate issues in the provided reinforcement learning environment."

        abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive force in our society. Increasing applications in healthcare, transport, military, and other fields underscore the critical need for a comprehensive understanding and the robustness of an AI’s decision-making process. Neurosymbolic AI aims to create robust AI systems by integrating neural and symbolic AI techniques. We highlight the role of formal methods in such techniques, serving as a rigorous and structured backbone for symbolic AI methods.<br>Moreover, as a specific machine learning technique, we look at deep reinforcement learning (RL) with the promise that autonomous systems can learn to operate in unfamiliar environments with minimal human intervention. However, why haven’t most autonomous systems implemented RL yet? The answer is simple: there are significant unsolved challenges. One of the most important ones is obvious: Autonomous systems operate in unfamiliar, unknown environments. This lack of knowledge is called uncertainty. This talk will explore why making decisions that account for this uncertainty is essential to achieving trustworthiness, reliability, and safety in RL."

        topic: B
        abstract: The proof assistant Isabelle/HOL is made available inside a flexible system framework allowing for logically safe extensions, which comprise both theories as well as implementations for code-generation, documentation, and specific support for a variety of formal methods. Following the techniques in [23] and the theoretical groundwork in [5], we show the major milestones for the implementation of a B-Tool and the resulting refinement method inside the Isabelle/HOL platform. The pro- totype HOL-B provides IDE support, documentation support, a theory for the Z-Mathematical Toolkit underlying the B-Method, and a gener- ated denotational semantics for the B-Machine concept implemented as specification construct in Isabelle/HOL. Extended by more automated proof machinery geared to refinements, HOL-B can serve as a more portable, flexible and extensible tool for Event-B that may profit from the large Isabelle/HOL libraries providing Algebra and Analysis theories.

        topic: B
        abstract: "Testing non-deterministic systems is challenging due to un- predictable behaviours arising from timing, concurrency, and random in- puts. This paper explores the application of model-based testing (MBT) to tackle these challenges, leveraging formal methods and tools to en- sure systematic test coverage. We employ ProB, a model checker for the B method, to analyse a formal model of the system under test (SUT) and generate test scenarios from the formal B model. As a proof of con- cept, we apply MBT to the TLS 1.3 protocol, a widely used complex cryptographic standard, and test one of its implementation using the BouncyCastle OpenSSL Java API. While the TLS handshake is primar- ily deterministic, it includes non-deterministic components like cipher selection and random value generation, making it an excellent candidate for evaluating MBT’s effectiveness. We present the design and logic of our proof of concept, showcasing its flexibility to support various mod- els and SUTs. This study demonstrates that combining formal meth- ods, non-deterministic analysis, and state-based testing can effectively address the challenges of non-deterministic systems, enabling improved testing strategies and greater system reliability."

        topic: Doctoral Symposium
        abstract: "Logical specifications are widely used to represent software systems and their desired properties. Under system degradation or environmental changes, commonly seen in complex real-world robotic systems, these properties may no longer hold and so traditional verification methods will simply fail to construct a proof. However, weaker versions of these properties do still hold and can be useful for understanding the system’s behaviour in uncertain conditions, as well as aiding compositional verification. We present a counterexample-guided technique for iteratively weakening properties, apply it to propositional logic specifications, and discuss planned extensions to state-based representations."

        author: Christophe Chen
        topic: Doctoral Symposium
        abstract: "An Assurance Case (AC) is a structured argumentation for certification describing how industrial activities support system requirements. The principle of AC relies on a goal (requirement) decomposition strategy that recursively breaks down an abstract goal into more concrete sub-goals until evidences become directly relevant to substantiate the goal. The most widely used notation for AC is the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN), which provides a graphical representation of argument structures. Despite the advances in the definition of a methodology for developing AC using the GSN, establishing the soundness of ACs relies essentially on experts reviews. Indeed, the lack of rigorous semantics for the GSN hinders the application of formal methods to check the consistency of ACs. The objective of our work is to design a logical (i.e., proof-based) framework supporting the definition of formalised ACs, in order to assist system designers and certification authorities in building goal structures and check their consistency with respect to the formalised semantics and domain knowledge model formalising system specific concepts. The proposed framework will be grounded on the Event-B method and associated algebraic theories. The proposed framework shall define formal semantics for each GSN component (goal, evidence, assumption, strategy, etc. ) and formalise the implicit rationale behind goal decomposition. By leveraging a clear proof mechanism for the AC expressed in GSN, the impact analysis on argument modification will be controlled. Moreover, references to knowledge models and system models will be made explicit in order to enhance traceability."
