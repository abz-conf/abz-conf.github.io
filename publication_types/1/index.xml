&lt;p>We propose a definition of a class of reflective Abstract State Machines (ASMs) that extends the class of Parallel Guarded Assignments (PGAs), a subclass of single-agent sequential ASMs, and can serve as ground model for refinements of reflectivity in concrete programming languages.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Humans are good at understanding subjective or vague statements which, however, are hard to express in classical logic. Fuzzy logic is an evolution of classical logic that can cope with vague terms by handling degrees of truth and not just the crisp values true and false. Logic is the formal basis of computing, enabling the formal design of systems supported by tools such as model checkers and theorem provers.This paper shows how a model checker such as Alloy can evolve to handle both classical and fuzzy logic, enabling the specification of high-level quantitative relational models in the fuzzy domain. In particular, the paper showcases how QAlloy-F (a conservative, general-purpose quantitative extension to standard Alloy) can be used to tackle fuzzy problems, namely in the context of validating the design of fuzzy controllers. The evaluation of QAlloy-F against examples taken from various classes of fuzzy case studies shows the approach to be feasible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The use of SAT-based model finding for specification analysis is a crucial characteristic of Alloy, and a main reason of its success as a language for software specification. When a property of a specification is analyzed and deemed satisfiable, the user usually explores instances of the corresponding satisfiability, in order to understand the analysis outcome. The order in which instances are obtained during exploration can impact the efficiency and effectiveness with which specification analysis is carried out. This has been observed by various researchers, and different instance exploration strategies have been proposed, besides the standard SAT-solver driven strategy implemented with the Alloy Analyzer. In this paper, we concentrate on a strategy recently proposed in the literature, that we refer to as “field-value” driven, and has been implemented in the tool HawkEye. The tool allows the user to interactively guide instance exploration, by enforcing constraints requiring fields to contain (resp., do not contain) specific values. We design an experiment involving faulty Alloy specifications featuring combinations of over constraints and under constraints, and perform a user study to analyze the impact of this instance exploration strategy, in comparison with the standard SAT-solver driven exploration. The study focuses on HawkEye’s facility of interactive instance querying and how it may favor users, in its current realization, during Alloy model analysis and debugging. We perform an assessment of the evaluation, and summarize some of the reasons that may diminish the impact of field-value exploration in model finding.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the design of autonomous systems, seamless integration with human operators is crucial, particularly when humans are considered as a fail-safe for intervening in hazardous situations. This study presents an Event-B intervention timing pattern designed to include human drivers’ responses when they act as fallback mechanisms in Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) systems. The proposed pattern outlines specific timings for driver interventions following alerts from SDVs, offering a clear set of expectations and conditions for human drivers during these critical takeover instances. The usability of this pattern is demonstrated through a case study, highlighting its importance for situations that require interventions. Ultimately, it sheds light on the operational aspects of SDVs, ensuring a safe and orderly transition from automated to manual control.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apache Kafka is a distributed, fault-tolerant and highly available open-source technology that utilizes a publish-subscribe communication model to stream large volumes of data. It is widely being used in various domains such as finance, entertainment, online education, and e-commerce for real-time data processing and analytics. This paper demonstrates an application of Alloy 6—the latest version of Alloy with built-in temporal logic operators—to formal modeling and analysis of a complex distributed system like Kafka. The architecture and key operations of Kakfa are modeled, and its various properties, including fault-tolerance, data availability, service availability, consistency, and recoverability, are analyzed using the Alloy Analyzer. The result of the analysis provides insights into how Kafka maintains the properties that it claims to have, and the circumstances under which these properties may be violated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Formal methods play a crucial role in modeling and quality assurance, but to be deployed on real systems, formal specifications need to be translated into implementation. Manually converting formal models into code poses challenges such as increased costs, limitations in specification reuse, and the potential for introducing errors. To overcome these limitations, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches enable developers to generate software code automatically. This paper proposes the Asmeta2Java tool for the automatic translation of formal Asmeta specifications into executable Java code. The designers start at an abstract level and perform refinement steps and verification activities. At the end, they automatically generates the code by applying the model-to-code transformation. Moreover, a process to validate and evaluate the transformation is presented.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>B, Event-B and TLA+ are modelling notations based on set theory. Dedukti/Lambdapi is a logical framework based on the (\lambda \Pi )-calculus modulo rewriting in which many theories and logics can be expressed. In the context of ICSPA (ANR project), Lambdapi will be used to exchange models and proofs between the set theory-based formal methods B, Event-B and TLA+. They will rely on the encoding of the respective set theories in Lambdapi. Our current work focuses on translating the mathematical language of Event-B and proof trees obtained with the Rodin platform for Event-B.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Refinement of Event-B machines is based on changing internal variables to obtain different data representations. One approach is expressed only in terms of internal variables. In the extreme case it permits refining a machine by another by choosing the gluing invariant “true”. The other one is based on relating external variables that can be refined functionally, so that properties expressed in terms of external variables are preserved. In practice, the first approach is used and gluing invariants are suitably chosen to achieve a meaningful relationship between refined machines. The second approach is based on the idea of observing a machine in terms of its external variables. It is more complicated, restrictive and not commonly used. In this paper we propose a different approach to observing Event-B machines that is more constraining than the first approach but less complicated and restrictive than the second approach. We extend Event-B refinement by permitting introducing new events and eliminating old events. The concept of observation is made more flexible by permitting non-observation of certain states as well as observing sets of values related to a states.

&lt;p>Based on the logic of non-deterministic Abstract State Machines (ASMs) we define a modal extension (\mathcal{M}\mathcal{L}&lt;em>{\text {ASM}})  by first introducing multi-step predicates and then adding quantification over the number of steps. We show that liveness conditions such as invariance, conditional and unconditional progress, and persistence on all or some runs of an ASM can be expressed in this logic. We show the existence of a complete fragment of (\mathcal{M}\mathcal{L}&lt;/em>{\text {ASM}}), which still contains the interesting liveness conditions, and demonstrate the usefulness of this complete fragment by an example concerning mutual exclusion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are widely used in the formalization and verification of the semantics of software or hardware. However, tools for assisting this process for evolving specifications are still lacking. With evolving we denote adding extensions without refactoring. We want to create a tool assisting in the verification of evolving specifications. Our approach is to translate ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, construct the proofs as far as possible automatically, and check the proofs with the proof checker. Further, we want proofs of evolvable specifications also to be evolvable. This paper gives a brief overview of the approach and discusses the first step of this work, namely the translation of ASM specifications into the language of an existing proof checker, with consideration of automation possibilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper introduces the ABZ 2024 Case Study: Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV), inspired by the Mechanical Ventilator Milano developed during COVID-19. The case study reports the specification of the Mechanical Lung Ventilator used to ventilate patients who are not able to breathe on their own or need ventilation support. Expected contributions to the case study include, among others, modeling, validation and verification, management of temporal behavior, modeling of the graphical user interface or automatically generating executable source code.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Petri-nets and their variants (Place/Transition nets, High-Level Petri Nets, etc.) are widely used in the development of safety critical-systems. Their success is related to three major aspects: a formal semantics, a graphical syntax and the availability of verification tools. In our previous work we presented a new vision for the semantic definition of Petri-nets applying a Formal Model-Driven Engineering (FMDE) built on the B method. The approach is powered by Meeduse, a language workbench that we developed in order to formally instrument executable Domain-Specific Languages (xDSLs) by applying a deep embedding technique and the B method. However, because of the abstract nature of the underlying formal models, our deep embedding is suitable for the validation and verification activities at the design stage but not sufficient to generate code for target platforms. This paper advances our previous work with a shallow embedding technique taking benefit of the B method tools in order to safely synthesize executable Petri-net controllers that can be embedded in target platforms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Railway systems belong to the domain of critical systems, where safety is a paramount concern. To ensure safety, testing methods have been implemented to adhere to certain standards. However, for large projects, it is impossible to test every possible scenarios, which can lead to gaps in the testing process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This “journal-first” paper summarises a publication by the same authors in the journal Logical Methods in Computer Science which describes a formal semantics for the Event-B specification language using the theory of institutions. It defines an institution for Event-B and shows how the constructs of the Event-B specification language can be mapped into our institution. This algebraic semantics distinguishes three constituent sub-languages of Event-B: the superstructure, infrastructure and mathematical languages. An important impact of this work is that our semantics provides access to the generic modularisation constructs available in institutions, including specification-building operators for parameterisation and refinement. We demonstrate how these features subsume and enhance the corresponding features already present in Event-B through a detailed study of their use in a worked example. Further benefits of the institutional approach are its provision for mathematically definable interoperability to facilitate heterogeneous specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Crucible is a suite of tools supporting the use of Alloy as a functional specification language for high-integrity software systems. It incorporates a test generator, animator and range of supporting tools. Test generation is achieved by producing test conditions from the input Alloy model, and then using the Alloy Analyzer to produce solutions. The solutions can optionally be converted into executable tests targeting a range of implementation languages. The animator allows scenarios to be defined by users and run to help stakeholders validate the Alloy model. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Crucible tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the design of critical systems, it is important to ensure a degree of formality so that we reason about safety and security at early stages of analysis and design, rather than detect problems later. Influenced by ideas from STPA we present a hierarchical analysis process that aims to justify the design and flow-down of derived critical requirements arising from safety hazards and security vulnerabilities identified at the system level. At each level, we verify that the design achieves the safety/security requirements by backing the analysis with formal modelling and proof using Event-B refinement. The formal model helps to identify hazards/vulnerabilities arising from the design and how they relate to the safety accidents/security losses being considered at this level. We then re-apply the same process to each component of the design in a hierarchical manner. Thus we use ideas from STPA, backed by Event-B models, to drive the design, replacing the system level requirements with component requirements. In doing so, we decompose critical requirements down to components, transforming them from abstract system level requirements, towards concrete solutions that we can implement correctly so that the hazards/vulnerabilities are eliminated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The (\textrm{TLA}^{+}) Proof System (TLAPS) allows users to verify proofs with the support of automated provers, including SMT solvers. To better ensure the soundness of TLAPS, we revisited the encoding of (\textrm{TLA}^{+}) into SMT-LIB, whose implementation had become too complex. Our approach is based on a first-order axiomatization with E-matching patterns. The new encoding is available with TLAPS and achieves performances similar to the previous version, despite its simpler design.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As the formal verification of safety-critical software systems often requires the integration of multiple tools and techniques, we propose a three-phase methodology incorporating two complementary workflows to ensure that the system in question fulfills its requirements. We use the Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) to structure the requirements so that they can be translated to other formalisms. These translations are then either incorporated directly into an existing model in Simulink, or used to construct a new formal model of the system. Our current use case is a model of a controller for a civilian aircraft engine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The modeling language of classical B is used to write specifications of various systems. Tools like ProB are able to use modelchecking techniques to verify invariants of these specifications such as safety-properties. However, classical B historically supports only discrete models and has additionally no notion of floating-point numbers and real numbers. Currently challenging scenarios and issues which any suitable solution must address are explored. An approach is proposed such that ProB may offer such a solution in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Proving theorems and properties on B models, recursively-defined functions is a convenient tool which is missing in B proofs. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a new theory without new concrete types and without axioms to enable the use of constructions by induction; This theory has been specified and proved within the Theory Plugin in Rodin. This induction theory clearly improves the existing B prover. This is illustrated in this paper by the implementation of ZFC in the Theory Plugin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the increasing complexity and scale of software-intensive systems, model-based system development requires composable system models and composition operators. In line with such a vision, this paper describes our experience in modeling the behavior of the MVM-Adapt, an adaptive version of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that has been designed, certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic for treating pneumonia. To keep the complexity of the requirements and models under control, we exploited a compositional modeling technique for discrete-event systems based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Essentially, separate ASMs represent the behavior of interacting subsystems of the MVM with their new adaptive functionalities; they can communicate with each other through I/O events, and co-operate by a precise orchestration schema.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the ABZ2020 Conference, the case study track proposed to model an Adaptive Exterior Light System and a Speed Control System: the former controls different exterior lights of a vehicle while the latter controls the speed of a vehicle. This paper introduces a model for these two case studies using Timed Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (TASTD). TASTD is an extension of Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (ASTD) providing timing operators to express timing constraints. The specification makes extensive use of the TASTD modularity capabilities, thanks to its algebraic approach, to model the behaviour of different sensors and actuators separately. We validate our specification using the cASTD compiler, which translates the TASTD specification into a C++ program. This generated program can be executed in simulation mode to manually update the system clock to check timing constraints. The model is executed on the test sequences provided with the case study. The paper provides a comparison between the TASTD model and other solutions presented at the ABZ2020 Conference. The advantages of having modularisation, orthogonality, abstraction, hierarchy, real-time, and graphical representation in one notation are highlighted with the proposed model.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Event-B is a state-based correct-by-construction system design formal method relying on proof and refinement where system models are expressed using set theory and First Order Logic (FOL). Through the generation and discharging of proof obligations (POs), Event-B natively supports the establishment of properties such as safety invariant, convergence and refinement. Other properties, relevant to system verification, may be studied as well, but need to be explicitly formalised by the designer, or expressed in another formal method. This process compromises reusability and is error-prone, especially on larger systems. Recently, the reflexive EB4EB framework has been proposed for formalising Event-B concepts as first-class objects. It allows manipulating these concepts using FOL and set theory in Event-B. In this paper, we propose a rigorous methodology for extending the EB4EB framework, to support new system analysis mechanisms associated to properties that are not natively present in core Event-B. Thanks to the reflexive nature of this framework, new generic and reusable system properties and their associated POs are expressed once and for all, and for any refinement level. For specific systems, designers instantiate these properties and the associated POs are automatically generated and submitted to Event-B’s provers. This methodology is used to define three analyses: deadlock-freeness, invariant weakness analysis and reachability, all of which are demonstrated on a case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In ASTD, real-time models are not natively supported. Real-time requirements are pervasive in many systems, like control systems and cybersecurity. Timed Algebraic State Transition Diagrams (TASTD) is an extension of ASTD capable of specifying real-time models. TASTD gives ASTD the capability to handle time with new algebraic operators. This paper describes the syntax and semantics of these new time operators: delay, persistent delay, timeout, persistent timeout, and timed interrupt. These new time operators are specified using two new operators, persistent guard and interrupt. To illustrate our extension, we present a small case study of a sensor where we want to detect potential anomalies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a proof technique for proving refinements for general state-based models of concurrent systems that reduces proving forward simulations to thread-local, step-local proof obligations. Instances of this proof technique should be applicable to systems specified with ASM rules, B events, or Z operations. To exemplify the proof technique, we demonstrate it with a simple case study that verifies linearizability of a lock-free implementation of concurrent hash sets by showing that it refines an abstract concurrent system with atomic operations. Our theorem prover KIV translates programs to a set of transition rules and generates proof obligations according to the technique.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While refinement can help structure the modeling and proving process, it also forces the modeler to introduce features in a particular order. This means that features deeper in the refinement chain cannot be validated in isolation, making some reasoning unnecessarily intricate. In this paper, we present the AVoiR (Abstraction-Validation Obligation-Refinement) framework to ease validation of such complex refinement chains. The triptych AVoiR framework operates as follows: 1) We first simplify a complex model by abstracting away the noise, i.e., removing the information unrelated to properties under analysis. 2) Using the Validation Obligations (VOs) technique, we formalize the validation tasks of the desired property. 3) Finally, we trickle down the validation results by establishing the noiseless model as a parent of the initially investigated model through the standard refinement relationship. Furthermore, by using the technique of VO refinement, we establish the VOs of the abstract model on the initial model. We use a case study from the aviation domain to show the proposed framework’s effectiveness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Validating requirements for safety-critical systems with user interactions often involves techniques like animation, trace replay, and LTL model checking. However, animation and trace replay can be challenging since user and system events are not distinguished, and formulating LTL properties requires expertise. This work introduces interactive simulation, a new technique that combines domain-specific visualization of formal models with timed probabilistic simulation to create more realistic prototypes. It allows domain experts and users to interact with formal models and simulate the system/environment reactions. State diagrams are also generated for inspecting user interactions and system reactions. Finally, we demonstrate interactive simulation on the ABZ automotive case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Modelling hybrid systems using Event-B is challenging and users typically are unsure about whether their Event-B models are over/under-specified. In this short paper, we present a work-in-progress specification language called Cyclone to tackle this challenge. We demonstrate how one can use Cyclone to check an Event-B hybrid model using a car controller example. Our demonstration shows that Cyclone has a great potential to be used to verify Event-B hybrid models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an Event-B meta-modelisation of an Event-B project restricted to its context hierarchy which introduces the functional part of a development through sets, constants, axioms and theorems. We study the proposal of a new mechanism for Event-B. It consists in allowing to instantiate in a new context an already proved theorem in a given context. We investigate the validation of the instantiation mechanism in order to prove the validity of imported theorems. We also compare the proposal with similar mechanisms available within some existing theorem provers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an Event-B modeling of the general version of the Sliding Window Protocol (SWP). SWPs ensure reliable data transfer over unreliable media by routing frames together with their indexes. Providing SWPs with formal guarantees is recognized to be quite complex. The experiment we present here shows that Event-B refinement is a suitable approach to ensure the safety of the protocol. First a simple model is developed with unbounded frame indexes. Then bounded indexes and modular arithmetic are introduced, as concrete indexes have fixed size. At this “hybrid” level, unbounded indexes are not used any more in computations but they are still useful to express some properties. Finally, abstract general media are refined towards queues, as an example of implementation. All unbounded indexes fully disappear in the final model.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the security protocols domain, formal verification is more and more highly demanded to guarantee security assurance: humans increasingly depend on the use of connected devices in their daily life, so they must be protected against possible threats and accidents. However, formal verification, and in general the use of formal methods, is slowed by myths and misconceptions, mainly due to their mathematical base, which discourages many designers or engineers from their adoption. In this paper, we pose the basis for the long-term development of an ASM-based user-friendly framework for the formal verification of security protocols. We introduce a mathematical-based set of templates to formalise common patterns in security protocols and a set of security properties. These templates facilitate the protocol formal verification by providing built-in functions and domains, as well as transition rules and property schema, to be customised according to the specific protocol to be verified. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of their application to a number of well-known cryptographic security protocols.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MapReduce supports the processing of large data sets in parallel. It has been shown that MapReduce is an example for the use of the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) bridging model, a model for parallel computation on a fixed set of processors comprising alternating computation and communication phases. In this article we extend the normal execution of MapReduce from processing large finite data sets to processing stream queries with input data stream assumed to continue indefinitely. We classify stream queries into three classes, memoryless, semi-memoryless and memorable, and provide the model for each class using MapReduce based on BSP. In addition, as some stream queries require large amounts of computing sources, the BSP computation model is extended to a model with unbounded many agents, but preserving the barrier synchronization. A behavioral theory is developed for this model extending the behavioral theory of the BSP model. This comprises an axiomatization, the definition of Infinite-Agent BSP abstract state machines (Inf-Ag-BSP-ASM) and the proof that such ASMs capture the unbounded synchronized computations. Finally, we show how MapReduce processing can be further improved on grounds of the unbounded extension.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The validation of a formal model consists of checking its conformance with actual requirements. In the context of (Event-) B, some temporal aspects can typically be validated by LTL or CTL model checking, while other properties can be validated via interactive animation or trace replay. In this paper, we present a new simulation-based validation technique for (Event-) B models called SimB. The proposed technique uses annotations to construct simulations, taking probabilistic and real-time aspects of the models into account. In this fashion, statistical properties of a single simulation run or a series of runs can be checked (e.g., Monte Carlo estimation or hypothesis tests). SimB complements animation and model checking, and its usability has been assessed via several case studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Event-B, a refinement-based formal modelling language, has traditionally focused on safety, but now increasingly finds a new role in developing secure systems. In this paper we take a fresh look at security and focus on what security means for the system rather than looking at detailed protocols. We use Event-B for proving security from an abstract view and refining it towards design details, focusing on the refinement of the availability property of the system. We define a general approach to guarantee the availability of events by ensuring the non-strengthening of their guards, taking into consideration their parameter types. We illustrate our approach using a smart ballot system, an integral part of modern voting systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To overcome the practical limitations of partial-order runs of ‘distributed ASMs’ (Abstract State Machines) proposed by Gurevich, we have defined a concept of concurrent runs of multi-agent ASMs and could show that concurrent ASMs capture a natural language-independent axiomatic definition of concurrent algorithms, thus generalising Gurevich’s seminal ‘Sequential ASM Thesis’ from sequential to concurrent algorithms. However, we remained intrigued by the fact that Blass and Gurevich used partial-order runs of distributed ASMs to explain runs of sequential recursive algorithms. We discovered that also the inverse simulation holds: for every distributed ASM with partial order runs, these runs can be described by runs of a sequential recursive algorithm. This surprising result clarifies the difference in expressivity between partial-order and concurrent runs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Interactive system development does not follow the same life cycle as other system developments. The essential differences lie in the iterative nature of such system development. Throughout iterations, the requirements undergo many changes due to the evolution of customer’s needs and user feedback after experiencing prototypes. The challenge is tougher in the case of critical HCI (aircraft cockpits, medical systems, nuclear power plant etc.). Indeed, critical HCI requires to be designed and built such that safety and security requirements are thoroughly fulfilled. This paper presents a novel development framework featuring formal verification and validation of critical interactive systems at modelling level. It identifies the several challenges of the interactive system development and settles down the main objectives. Furthermore, it sketches the most important traits of the proposed approach to circumvent the enumerated challenges. Hence, we discuss the importance of the pivot language Fluid, the domain theory specific to interactive systems and their modelling using Event-B.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Reflective algorithms are algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs). Reflective ASMs exploit extended states that include an updatable representation of the ASM signature and rules to be executed by the machine in that state. Updates to the representation of ASM signatures and rules are realised by means of a sophisticated tree algebra defined in the background of the rASM. In this paper the theory is taken further by an extension of the logic of ASMs to capture inferences on rASMs. The key is the introduction of terms that are interpreted by ASM rules stored in some location. We show that fragments of the logic with a fixed bound on the number of steps preserve completeness, whereas the full run-logic for rASMs becomes incomplete.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different backends of the ProB constraint solver. For this, we train a random forest over a database of constraints to classify whether a backend is able to find a solution within a given amount of time or answers unknown. The forest is then analysed in regards of feature importances to determine subsets of the B language in which the respective backends excel or lack for performance. The results are compared to our initial assumptions over each backend’s performance in these subsets based on personal experiences. While we do employ classifiers, we do not aim for a good predictor, but are rather interested in analysis of the classifier’s learned knowledge over the utilised B constraints. The aim is to strengthen our knowledge of the different tools at hand by finding subsets of the B language in which a backend performs better than others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Complex software systems can be described using modeling notations such as UML/OCL or Alloy. Then, some correctness properties of these systems can be checked using model finders, which compute sample scenarios either fulfilling the desired properties or illustrating potential faults. Such scenarios allow designers to validate, verify and test the system under development. Nevertheless, when asked to produce several scenarios, model finders tend to produce similar solutions. This lack of diversity impairs their effectiveness as testing or validation assets. To solve this problem, we propose the use of graph kernels, a family of methods for computing the (dis)similarity among pairs of graphs. With this metric, it is possible to cluster scenarios effectively, improving the usability of model finders and making testing and validation more efficient.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Choreographies prescribe the rendez-vous synchronisation of messages in a communicating system. Such a system is called realisable, if the traces of the prescribed communication coincide with those of the asynchronous system of peers, where the communication channels either use FIFO queues or multiset mailboxes. It has recently been shown that realisability can be characterised by two necessary conditions that together are also sufficient, whereas in general the synchronisability of communicating peers is undecidable. The sufficiency of the conditions permits the construction of correct communicating systems; their necessity shows that all choreography-defined communicating system can be obtained in this way. This article provides an integrated framework based on Event-B for such a construction with a major emphasis on Rodin-based proofs of correctness and completeness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents Alloy4Fun, a web application that enables online editing and sharing of Alloy models and instances (including dynamic ones developed with the Electrum extension), to be used mainly in an educational context. By introducing secret paragraphs and commands in the models, Alloy4Fun allows the distribution and automated assessment of simple specification challenges, a mechanism that enables students to learn the language at their own pace. Alloy4Fun stores all versions of shared and analyzed models, as well as derivation trees that depict how they evolved over time: this wealth of information can be mined by researchers or tutors to identify, for example, learning breakdowns in the class or typical mistakes made by Alloy users. Alloy4Fun has been used in formal methods graduate courses for two years and for the latest edition we present results regarding its adoption by the students, as well as preliminary insights regarding the most common bottlenecks when learning Alloy (and Electrum).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The decentralisation of railway signalling systems has the potential to increase railway network capacity, availability and reduce maintenance costs. Given the safety-critical nature of railway signalling and the complexity of novel distributed signalling solutions, their safety should be guaranteed by using thorough system validation methods. In this paper, we present a rigorous formal development and verification of a distributed protocol for reservation of railway sections, which we believe could deliver benefits of a decentralised signalling while ensuring safety and liveness properties. For the formal distributed protocol development and verification, we devised a multifaceted framework, which aims to reduce modelling and verification effort, while still providing complementary techniques to study protocol from all relevant perspectives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Internet is composed of many interconnected, interoperating networks. With the recent advances in Future Internet design, multiple new network architectures, especially Information-Centric Networks (ICN) have emerged. Given the ubiquity of networks based on the Internet Protocol (IP), it is likely that we will have a number of different interconnecting network domains with different architectures, including ICNs. Their interoperability is important, but at the same time difficult to prove. A formal tool can be helpful for such analysis. ICNs have a number of unique characteristics, warranting formal analysis, establishing properties that go beyond, and are different from, what have been used in the state-of-the-art because ICN operates at the level of content names rather than node addresses. We need to focus on node-to-content reachability, rather than node-to-node reachability. In this paper, we present a formal approach to model and analyze information-centric interoperability (ICI). We use Alloy Analyzer’s model finding approach to verify properties expressed as invariants for information-centric services (both pull and push-based models) including content reachability and returnability. We extend our use of Alloy to model counting, to quantitatively analyze failure and mobility properties. We present a formally-verified ICI framework that allows for seamless interoperation among a multitude of network architectures. We also report on the impact of domain types, routing policies, and binding techniques on the probability of content reachability and returnability, under failures and mobility.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a central role in modern days technology. From simple thermostat controllers to more advanced autonomous cars, their versatility makes them perfect candidates for many applications, in particular for safety critical ones. Thus, their certification is a key issue and formal methods are good candidates to assess safety and produce associated certificates. Hybrid systems show continuous-time dynamics depending on mode that is required in several stages of the architecture of Cyber-Physical Systems. Our work addresses the problem of formally verifying hybrid systems using refinement and proof with Event-B. Our previous work [14] presented formally verified generic architecture patterns for designing centralised hybrid systems, based on our generic approach [15]. We extend this work and give a formally verified architecture pattern aimed at modelling distributed hybrid systems, featuring multiple plants and multiple controllers. We validate the approach and illustrate the use of the defined pattern on an extension of a very common case study, borrowed from literature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Self-Driving Vehicles (SDVs) are considered to be safety-critical system. They may jeopardize the lives of passengers in the vehicle and people in the street, or damaging public property such as the transportation infrastructure. According to the National Transportation Safety Board report [1] of an Uber self-driving crash, the accident was caused by the internal components of SDVs when the AI module failed to detect a victim. The autonomous system was implemented to give a human driver control of a vehicle on the unmanaged areas; however, the driver was distracted and did not react within the appropriate time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Developing safety-critical systems requires to consider safety and real-time requirements in addition to functional requirements. Event-B is a formalism that is visualised by iUML-B and supports the development of functional aspects having rich verification and validation tools. However, it lacks well-established support for timing analysis. UPPAAL Timed Automata (UTA), on the other hand, address timing aspects of systems, and enable model checking reachability and timing properties. By integrating iUML-B and UTA, we combine the best verifying and validating practices from the two methods achieving a formal development of systems. We present the mapping for translating iUML-B constructs to UTA. The novel aspect is the use of a multi-process trigger-response pattern to address the modelling and verification of reachability properties of complex systems with concurrent processes. The approach is demonstrated on an airport control system, where timing, fairness, as well as liveness properties play a vital role in proving safety requirements.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hybrid systems are one of the most common mathematical models for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). They combine discrete dynamics represented by state machines or finite automata with continuous behaviors represented by differential equations. The measurement of continuous behaviors is performed by sensors. When these sensors have a continuous access to these measurements, we call such model an Event-Triggered model. The properties of this model are easier to prove, while its implementation is difficult in practice. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce a more realistic model, called Time-Triggered model, where the sensors take periodic measurements. Contrary to Event-Triggered models, Time-Triggered models are much easier to implement, but much more difficult to verify. Based on the differential refinement logic (dR(\mathcal {L})), a dynamic logic for refinement relations on hybrid systems, it is possible to prove that a Time-Triggered model refines an Event-Triggered model. The major limitation of such logic is that it is not supported by any prover. In this paper, we propose a correct-by-construction approach that implements the reasoning on hybrid programs particularly the reasoning of dR(\mathcal {L}) in Event-B to take advantage of its associated tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The CLEARSY Safety Platform (CSSP) is aimed at easing the development and the deployment of safety critical applications, up to the safety integrity level 4 (SIL4). It relies on the smart integration of the B formal method, redundant code generation and compilation, and a hardware platform that ensures a safe execution of the software. This paper exposes the programming model of the CSSP used to develop control &amp;amp; command applications based on digital I/Os.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper, we introduce a translation of the specification language Alloy to classical B. Our translation closely follows the Alloy grammar, each construct is translated into a semantically equivalent component of the B language. In addition to basic Alloy constructs, our approach supports integers and orderings. The translation is fully automated by the tool “Alloy2B”. We evaluate the usefulness by applying AtelierB and ProB to the translated models, and show benefits for proof and solving with integers and higher-order quantification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Type-2 Theory of Effectivity is a well established theory of computability on infinite strings, which in this paper is exploited to define a data type ( Real ) as part of the background structure of Abstract State Machines. Real numbers are represented by rapidly converging Cauchy sequences, on top of which standard operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc. can be defined. In this way exact computation with real numbers is enabled. Output can be generated at any degree of precision by exploring only sufficiently long prefixes of the representing Cauchy sequences.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known formal method, which can be used to specify arbitrary algorithms, applications or even whole systems. Over the past years, there have been many approaches to implement concrete ASM-based modeling and specification languages. All of those approaches define their type systems and operator semantics differently in their internal representation, which leads to undesired or unexpected behavior during the modeling, the execution, and code generation of such ASM specifications. In this paper, we present CASM-IR, an Intermediate Representation (IR), designed to aid ASM-based language engineering which is based on a well-formed ASM-based specification format. Moreover, CASM-IR is conceptualized from the ground up to ease the formalization of ASM-based analysis and transformation passes. The feasibility of CASM-IR solving the uniform ASM representation problem is depicted. Based on our CASM-IR implementation, we were able to integrate a front-end of our statically inferred Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) modeling language.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for enabling application protocols to support authentication, integrity and confidentiality services. The SASL was originally specified in RFC 2222, and later updated in RFC 4422, using natural language. However, due to the richness of natural language this involves ambiguities and imprecision. Whilst there is an Oracle implementation of SASL, its documentation also contains informal descriptions and under-defined specifications of the RFCs. This paper provides clarification of ambiguity in SASL using Abstract State Machines (ASMs). This clarification is based on two ASM essential notions: a ground model to capture the intended SASL behavior in an understandable way, and a refinement notion to accurately explicate the ambiguous parts of the behavior. We also show some differences between RFCs and the description of the Oracle implementation. We believe our work can serve as a basis for further implementation and for formal analysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper is about the extension of the SysML/KAOS requirements engineering method with domain models expressed as ontologies. More precisely, it concerns the translation of these ontologies into B System for system construction. The contributions of this paper are twofold. The first one is a formal semantics for the ontology modeling language. The second one is the formal definition of translation rules between ontologies and B system specifications in order to provide the structural part of the formal specification. These translation rules are modeled in Event-B. Their consistency and completeness are proved using Rodin. We show that they are structure preserving (two related elements within the source model remain related within the target model), by proving various isomorphisms between the ontology and the B System specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In (\textsc {TLA}^{+}), a system specification is written as a logical formula that restricts the system behavior. As a logic, (\textsc {TLA}^{+}) does not have assignments and other imperative statements that are used by model checkers to compute the successor states of a system state. Model checkers compute successors either explicitly — by evaluating program statements — or symbolically — by translating program statements to an SMT formula and checking its satisfiability. To efficiently enumerate the successors, TLA’s model checker TLC introduces side effects. For instance, an equality (x' = e) is interpreted as an assignment of e to the yet unbound variable x. Inspired by TLC, we introduce an automatic technique for discovering expressions in (\textsc {TLA}^{+}) formulas such as (x' = e) and (x' \in {e_1, \dots , e_k}) that can be provably used as assignments. In contrast to TLC, our technique does not explicitly evaluate expressions, but it reduces the problem of finding assignments to the satisfiability of an SMT formula. Hence, we give a way to slice a (\textsc {TLA}^{+}) formula in symbolic transitions, which can be used as an input to a symbolic model checker. Our prototype implementation successfully extracts symbolic transitions from a few (\textsc {TLA}^{+}) benchmarks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Normally, the passengers on urban rail systems remain fairly stationary, allowing for a relatively straightforward approach to controlling the dynamics of the system, based on the total rest mass of the train and passengers. However when a mischievous rugby club board an empty train and then run and jump-stop during the braking process, they can disrupt the automatic mechanisms for aligning train and platform doors. This is the rugby club problem for automated urban train control. A simple scenario of this kind is modelled in Hybrid Event-B, and sufficient conditions are derived for the prevention of the overshoot caused by the jump-stop. The challenges of making the model more realistic are discussed, and a strategy for dealing with the rugby club problem, when it cannot be prevented, is proposed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The design of hybrid systems controllers requires one to handle both discrete and continuous functionalities in a single development framework. In this paper, we propose the design and verification of such controllers using a correct-by-construction approach. We use proof-based formal methods to model and verify the required safety properties of the given controllers. Both Event-B with Rodin, and hybrid programs and dynamic differential logic with KeYmaera are experimented on a common case study related to the modelling of a car controller. Finally, we discuss the lessons learnt from these experiments and draw the first steps towards a generic method for modelling hybrid systems in Event-B.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Event-B is a refinement-based formal method that is used for system-level modeling and analysis of concurrent and distributed systems. Work has been done to extend Event-B with discrete time constraints. However the previous work does not capture the communication and competition between concurrent processes. In this paper, we distinguish task-based timing properties with scheduler-based timing properties from the perspective of different system design phases. To refine task-based timing properties with scheduler-based timing properties based on existing trigger-response patterns, we introduce a nondeterministic queue based scheduling framework to schedule processes under concurrent circumstances, which addresses the problems of refining deadline constraint under concurrent situations. Additional gluing invariants are provided to this refinement. To demonstrate the usability of the framework, we provide approaches to refine this framework with FIFO scheduling policy as well as deferrable priority based scheduling policy with aging technique. We demonstrate our framework and refinement with a timed mutual exclusion case study. The model is proved using the Rodin tool.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We introduce ASketch, the first framework for sketching models in the Alloy language. The Alloy Analyzer is a SAT-based constraint solver that allows users to create valuations for relations with respect to given constraints and bound on the universe of discourse. Alloy users routinely use the valuations to validate their models: enumerate some valuations and inspect them to detect underconstraints or overconstraints. Our key insight is that valid and invalid valuations enable sketching Alloy models where the user writes a partial model with holes and provides some valuations, and the sketching infrastructure completes the model by synthesizing Alloy fragments for the holes. ASketch offers the following extensions to Alloy: (1) it expands the Alloy grammar, allowing users to write holes in an Alloy model; (2) it can parse regular expressions and automatically generate pools of matching fragments to replace the holes; (3) it includes a solver-based technique that encodes the model with holes, the fragments for each hole, and the expected valuations to a meta-model which completes the holes when solved. Experimental results show that ASketch works well for different Alloy models with various number of holes, providing a promising approach to bring the success of traditional program sketching for imperative and functional programs to declarative, relational logic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Relational algebra forms the semantic foundation in multiple domains, e.g., Alloy models, OCL constraints, UML metamodels, and SQL queries. Synthesis and repair techniques in such domains require an efficient procedure to generate (non-equivalent) expressions subject to relational constraints, e.g., the types of sets and relations, their cardinality, size of expressions, maximum arity of the intermediate expressions, etc. This paper introduces the first generator for relational expressions that are non-equivalent with respect to the semantics of relational algebra. We present the algorithms that define our generator, its embodiment based on the Alloy tool-set, and an experimental evaluation to show the effectiveness of its non-equivalent generation for a variety of problems with relational constraints.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Graph algorithms that involve complex conditions on subgraphs can be specified much easier, if the specification allows expressions in higher-order logic to be used. In this paper an extension of Abstract State Machines by such expressions is introduced and its usefulness is demonstrated by examples of computations on graphs, such as graph factoring and checking self-similarity. In a naïve way these high-level specifications can be refined using submachines for the evaluation of the higher-order expressions. We show that refinements can be obtained in an automatic way for well-defined fragments of higher-order logic that collapse to second-order, by means of which the naïve refinement is only necessary for second-order logic expressions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scheduled Event-B (SEB) augments Event-B with a scheduling language to make the control flow in an Event-B model explicit and facilitate derivation of algorithmic structure in Event-B refinement. A concrete SEB model has a concrete algorithmic structure associated with it. Although this structure reduces the difficulty of code generation, there is still some gap between the model and executable code. This work formulates the translation of SEB models to a programming language called Dafny and proposes an approach in which a number of assertions are generated from the model that allows the verification of the generated code in a static program verifier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a translation of sequential ASMs to Event-B specifications. The translation also addresses the partial update problem, and allows a variable to be updated (consistently) in parallel. On the theoretical side, the translation highlights the intricacies of ASM rule execution in terms of Event-B semantics. On the practical side, we show on a series of examples that the Event-B encoding remains compact and is amenable to proof within Rodin as well as animation and model checking using ProB.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Peer-to-peer protocols for maintaining distributed hash tables, such as Pastry or Chord, have become popular for a class of Internet applications. While such protocols promise certain properties concerning correctness and performance, verification attempts using formal methods invariably discover border cases that violate some of those guarantees. Tianxiang Lu reported correctness problems in published versions of Pastry and also developed a model, which he called LuPastry, for which he provided a partial proof of correct delivery assuming no node departures, mechanized in the TLA(^+) Proof System. Lu’s proof is based on certain assumptions that were left unproven. We found counter-examples to several of these assumptions. In this paper, we present a revised model and rigorous proof of correct delivery, which we call LuPastry(^+). Aside from being the first complete proof, LuPastry(^+) also improves upon Lu’s work by reformulating parts of the specification in such a way that the reasoning complexity is confined to a small part of the proof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Abstract State Machines can be used to specify arbitrary system behaviour. However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g., in which order, the rules are executed. This reduces the readability and comprehensibility of specifications and can introduce additional defects to them. We propose a new syntax construct for the specification of control flow for the ASM language which improves the compactness and readability of specifications by providing syntactic elements for often manually realised behaviour. This construct enables to parametrise which rules shall be selected for execution and how the selected rules are executed. We illustrate how the control construct can improve the code’s readability on some examples. The proposed control construct is also released as a plugin for CoreASM.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper we present a static analysis to determine how events influence each other in Event-B models. The analysis, called an enabling analysis, uses syntactic and constraint-based techniques to compute the effect of executing one event on the guards of another event. We describe the foundations of the approach along with the realisation in ProB. The output of the analysis can help a user to understand the control flow of a formal model. Additionally, we discuss how the information of the enabling analysis can be used to obtain a new optimised model checking algorithm. We evaluate both the performance of the enabling analysis and the new model checking technique on a variety of models. The technique is also applicable to B, (\mathrm{TLA}^{+}), and Z models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an encoding of a non-temporal fragment of the ({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}) language, which includes untyped set theory, functions, arithmetic expressions, and Hilbert’s (\varepsilon ) operator, into many-sorted first-order logic, the input language of state-of-the-art smt solvers. This translation, based on encoding techniques such as boolification, injection of unsorted expressions into sorted languages, term rewriting, and abstraction, is the core component of a back-end prover based on smt solvers for the ({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}) Proof System.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper, we propose a formal framework enhancing the termination detection property of distributed algorithms and reusing their specifications as well as their proofs. By relying on refinement and composition, we show that an algorithm specified with local termination detection, can be reused in order to compute the same algorithm with global termination detection. The main idea relies upon the development of distributed algorithms following a top/down approach and the integration of additional computation steps developed in a pre-defined module. This module is specified in a generic and scalable way in order to be composed with particular developments. Once the composition link is proven, the global termination emerges automatically.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a high-level algorithm description language which is translated to Event-B specifications for simulation, model checking and proof. Rather than trying to recover the program structure from a lower-level Event-B specification, we start with a high-level description of the algorithm. Our goals are more tractable code generation and more convenient modelling, while keeping the power of the Event-B method in terms of proof and refinement. We present various examples of algorithm descriptions and show that our translation ensures that they can be completely proven within Rodin while achieving a high-level of automatic proof.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The share of formal methods is still marginal in contemporary systems and software engineering. One of the reasons is the absence of systematic guidelines and evaluation criteria that help software practitioners choose the right formal method for the problem at hand. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of criteria, based on a systematic literature review and decade-long personal experience in industrial projects, for evaluating and comparing different formal methods. We argue that besides technical grounds (e.g., modeling capabilities and supported development phases), formal methods should also be evaluated from social and industrial perspectives. At the end of the paper, we present an evaluation of “ABZ” methods based on the stipulated criteria.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We show how to model distributed algorithms by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Comparing these models with Petri nets (PNs) reveals a certain number of idiosyncrasies of PNs which complicate both model design and analysis. The ASMs we define illustrate how one can avoid such framework related technicalities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Efficient reuse is a goal of many software engineering strategies and is useful in the safety-critical domain where formal development is required. Event-B can be used to develop safety-critical systems, but could be improved by a component-based reuse strategy. In this paper, we outline a component-based reuse methodology for Event-B. It provides a means for bottom-up scalability, and can also be used with the existing top-down approach. We describe the process of creating library components, their composition, and specification of new properties (involving the composed elements). We introduce Event-B component interfaces and propose to use a diagrammatic representation of component instances (based on iUML-B) which can be used to describe the relationships between the composed elements. We also discuss the specification of communication flow across component boundaries and describe the additional proof obligations that are required.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have implemented various symbolic model checking algorithms, like BMC, k-Induction and IC3 for B and Event-B. The high-level nature of B and Event-B accounts for complicated constraints arising in these symbolic analysis techniques. In this paper we suggest using static information stemming from proof obligations to simplify occurring constraints. We show how to include proof information in the aforementioned algorithms. Using different benchmarks we compare explicit state to symbolic model checking as well as techniques with and without proof assistance. In particular for models with large branching factor, e.g., due to complicated data values being manipulated, the symbolic techniques fare much better than explicit state model checking. The inclusion of proof information results in further clear performance improvements.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Executions in the PharOS real-time system are deterministic in the sense that the sequence of local states for every process is independent of the order in which processes are scheduled. The essential ingredient for achieving this property is that a temporal window of execution is associated with every instruction. Messages become visible to receiving processes only after the time window of the sending message has elapsed. We present a high-level model of PharOS in TLA+ and formally state and prove determinacy using the TLA+ Proof System.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Constraint satisfaction and data validation problems can be expressed very elegantly in state-based formal methods such as B. However, is B suited for developing larger applications and are there existing tools that scale for these projects? In this paper, we present our experiences on two real-world data validation projects from different domains which are based on the B language and use ProB as the central validation tool. The first project is the validation of university timetables, and the second project is the validation of railway topologies. Based on these two projects, we present a general structure of a data validation project in B and outline common challenges along with various solutions. We also discuss possible evolutions of the B language to make it (even) more suitable for such projects.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Situation Analysis is critical for dynamic decision-making in responding to real-world situations. The complex and intricate nature of situation analysis processes calls for evolutionary modeling and formal engineering methods that facilitate experimental validation of abstract mathematical descriptions to link the essential design aspects with rapid prototyping in early development phases. For the transition from abstract concepts and requirements to precise specifications to high level design of situation analysis systems, we derive here a generic ASM ground model as a framework for defining the precise meaning of fundamental situation analysis concepts applicable to different application domain models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MapReduce is a powerful distributed data processing model that is currently adopted in a wide range of domains to efficiently handle large volumes of data, i.e., cope with the big data surge. In this paper, we propose an approach to formal derivation of the MapReduce framework. Our approach relies on stepwise refinement in Event-B and, in particular, the event refinement structure approach – a diagrammatic notation facilitating formal development. Our approach allows us to derive the system architecture in a systematic and well-structured way. The main principle of MapReduce is to parallelise processing of data by first mapping them to multiple processing nodes and then merging the results. To facilitate this, we formally define interdependencies between the map and reduce stages of MapReduce. This formalisation allows us to propose an alternative architectural solution that weakens blocking between the stages and, as a result, achieves a higher degree of parallelisation of MapReduce computations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a formal modelling approach using Abstract Data Types (ADTs) for developing large-scale systems in Event-B. The novelty of our approach is the combination of refinement and instantiation techniques to manage the complexity of systems under development. With ADTs, we model system components on an abstract level, specifying only the necessary properties of the components. At the same time, we postpone the introduction of their concrete definitions to later development steps. We evaluate our approach using a largescale case study in train control systems. The results show that our approach helps reduce system details during early development stages and leads to simpler and more automated proofs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the paradigm of aspect orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too. For example, security aspects can be separated from the rest of the specification. Another use case for aspect orientation in specifications is the extension of specifications without touching the original ones. The definition of formal semantics for UML profiles without changing the original UML specification is an example for this application. This paper describes the implementation of the aspect oriented approach in Abstract State Machines. We introduce an aspect language with its syntax and formal semantics. It allows for specifying pointcuts where an original specification is augmented with aspect specification. Besides the general overview of this language extension, some ASM specific features of the realization are depicted in detail.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The formal development of multi-agent systems (MAS) may involve consideration of system functionality at three distinct levels of abstraction. The macro level focusses on the system’s overall, global behaviour, independently of how the agents of the system operate and interact. The meso level focusses on agent interactions, and the micro level on the operation of individual agents. While Object-Z with its high-level support for component-based specifications is well suited to modelling MAS at the macro and meso levels, it can become cumbersome at the micro level where the low-level mechanisms required for dealing with asynchronous communication between agents and timing constraints need to be explicitly defined. In this paper we introduce MAZE, an extension of Object-Z supporting (i) action refinement to facilitate the development process from the macro to micro level, and (ii) a number of syntactic conventions to facilitate micro-level specification. The syntactic conventions are shorthands for existing Object-Z notation and so require no redefinition of Object-Z’s semantics.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Software product line (SPL) engineering involves the modeling, analysis, and configuration of variability-rich systems. We improve the performance of the multi-objective optimization of SPLs in Alloy by several orders of magnitude with two techniques. First, we rewrite the model to remove binary relations that map to integers, which enables removing most of the integer atoms from the universe. SPL models often require using large bitwidths, hence the number of integer atoms in the universe can be orders of magnitude more than the other atoms. In our approach, the tuples for these integer-valued relations are computed outside the sat solver before returning the solution to the user. Second, we add a checkpointing facility to Kodkod, which allows the multi-objective optimization algorithm to reuse previously computed internal sat solver state, after backtracking. Together these result in orders of magnitude improvement in using Alloy as a multi-objective optimization tool for software product lines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Anticipation proof obligations for stated variants need to be proved in Event-B even if the variant has no variables in common with anticipated event. This often leads to models that are complicated by additional auxiliary variables and variants that need to take into account these variables. Because of such “encodings” of control flow information in the variants the corresponding proof obligations can usually not be discharged automatically. We present a new proof obligation for anticipated events that does not have this defect and prove it correct. The proof is fairly intricate due to the nondeterminism of the simulations that link refinements. An informal soundness argument suggests using a lexicographic product in the soundness proof. However, it turns out that a weaker order is required which we call quasi-lexicographic product.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We define a programming language independent transaction controller and an operator which when applied to concurrent programs with shared locations turns their behavior with respect to some abstract termination criterion into a transactional behavior. We prove the correctness property that concurrent runs under the transaction controller are serialisable. We specify the transaction controller TaCtl and the operator TA in terms of Abstract State Machines. This makes TaCtl applicable to a wide range of programs and in particular provides the possibility to use it as a plug-in when specifying concurrent system components in terms of Abstract State Machines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We argue that B is a good language to conveniently express a wide range of constraint satisfaction problems. We also show that some problems can be solved quite effectively by the ProB tool. We illustrate our claim on several examples, such as the jobs puzzle - for which we solve the challenge set out by Shapiro. Here we show that the B formalization is both very close to the natural language specification and can still be solved efficiently by ProB. Our approach is particularly interesting when a high assurance of correctness is required. Indeed, compared to other existing approaches and tools, validation and double checking of solutions is available for ProB and formal proof can be applied to establish important properties or provide an unambiguous semantics to the problem specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The state-based formal methods B and TLA  +  share the common base of predicate logic, arithmetic and set theory. However, there are still considerable differences, such as the way to specify state transitions, the different approaches to typing, and the available tool support. In this paper, we present a translation from B to TLA  +  to validate B specifications using the model checker TLC. We provide translation rules for almost all constructs of B, in particular for those which are not built-in in TLA  + . The translation also includes many adaptations and optimizations to allow efficient checking by TLC. Moreover, we present a way to validate liveness properties for B specifications under fairness conditions. Our implemented translator, Tlc4B, automatically translates a B specification to TLA  + , invokes the model checker TLC, and translates the results back to B. We use ProB to double check the counter examples produced by TLC and replay them in the ProB animator. We also present a series of case studies and benchmark tests comparing Tlc4B and ProB.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We validate the RBAC ANSI 2012 standard using the B method. Numerous problems are identified: logical errors, inconsistencies, ambiguities, typing errors, missing preconditions, invariant violation, inappropriate specification notation. A clean version of the standard written in the B notation is proposed. We argue that the ad hoc mathematical notation used in the standard is inappropriate and we propose that a more methodological and tool-supported approach must definitely be used for writing standards, in order to avoid the issues identified in the paper. Human reviewing is insufficient to produce error-free international standards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present αRby—an embedding of the Alloy language in Ruby—and demonstrate the benefits of having a declarative modeling language (backed by an automated solver) embedded in a traditional object-oriented imperative programming language. This approach aims to bring these two distinct paradigms (imperative and declarative) together in a novel way. We argue that having the other paradigm available within the same language is beneficial to both the modeling community of Alloy users and the object-oriented community of Ruby programmers. In this paper, we primarily focus on the benefits for the Alloy community, namely, how αRby provides elegant solutions to several well-known, outstanding problems: (1) mixed execution, (2) specifying partial instances, (3) staged model finding.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Specifications of programs frequently involve operators and functions that are not defined over all of their (syntactic) domains. Proofs about specifications –and those to discharge proof obligations that arise in justifying steps of design– must be based on formal rules. Since classical logic deals only with defined values, some extra thought is required. There are several ways of handling terms that can fail to denote a value — this paper provides a semantically based comparison of three of the best known approaches. In addition, some pointers are given to further alternatives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Previous work described how to translate Simulink control law diagrams into Circus specifications to facilitate verification by refinement. This is not a trivial task; several tools have been developed to automate parts of the translation. This paper introduces a new tool chain that extends and integrates existing technology to cover the entire translation and cater for a larger set of diagrams. Our contributions include the integration of data types, generic definitions, and extension of the technique to model action and enabled subsystems. The tool chain has been validated using an industrial case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper, we use Alloy Analyzer, a fully automatic checker, to detect vulnerabilities in the multicast key management protocol proposed by Tanaka and Sato, and discover some previously unknown attacks. We model an active intruder in Alloy, and use Alloy Analyzer to test whether the active intruder can successfully attack the protocol. In this analysis, we check four critical properties that should be satisfied by any secure multicast protocol. However, none of these properties are satisfied. The protocol cannot resist the active intruder. Two unknown flaws caused by the active intruder are disclosed, and another two flaws found by CORAL are identified.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We define an abstract standards-compliant web browser model. The model focuses on those parts of the browser behaviour which are most relevant for the deployment and execution of web applications, such as interaction with a scripting language (here, ECMAScript), cookies, and asynchronous behaviour of the network layer, while hiding other aspects, such as page navigation and presentational issues. We use a multi-agent Abstract State Machine as our formal model, showing how the browser behaviour can be partitioned into a number of distinct components, and specifying precisely their interactions. The specification can also be used as basis to prove consistency properties of common frameworks for web applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While many systems are naturally viewed as the interaction between a controller subsystem and a controlled, or plant subsystem, they are often most easily understood and designed monolithically. A practical implementation needs to separate controller from plant. We study the problem of when a monolithic ASM system can be split into controller and plant subsystems along syntactic lines derived from variables’ natural affiliations. We give restrictions that enable the split to be carried out cleanly, and we give conditions that ensure that the resulting pair of controller and plant subsystems have the same behaviours as the original design. We illustrate the theory with a case study concerning eating with chopsticks. This leads to an extension of controller synthesis for continuous ASM systems, which are briefly covered. The case study is then extended into the continuous sphere.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Formal methods have been used and successfully applied to a wide range of industrial applications for many years. However formal methods can be difficult to comprehend for outsiders and the link of formal models and external subsystems which are not modelled can be unclear. In this paper we present an approach which allows formal models to be more easily shared with external stakeholders and enables integration with external code. We demonstrate how an existing interpreter for an executable subset of VDM is extended enabling the combination of formal models with executable code. This eases the way in which a formal model can communicate with an external implementation or be used in graphical prototyping. A small case study is used to demonstrate how the approach can be utilized. In this paper the technique is used to combine VDM and Java, but the principles presented can be seen as a general approach for expanding the capabilities of formal modelling tools with interpretation capabilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ASM framework is extended to include continuously varying quantities as well as conventional discretely changing ones. This opens the door to the more faithful modeling of many scenarios where digital systems have to interact with the continuously varying physical world. Transitions in the extended framework are thus either moded (for discontinuous changing quantities), or pliant (for smoothly changing quantities). Refinement and retrenchment are defined in the extended context. The framework is used to develop a fragment of a simple system for the sensing problem for cardiac pacemakers, in the context of the pacemaker verification challenge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Kodkod, the backend of Alloy4, incorporates new features for solving models where part of the solution, that is, a partial instance, is already known. Although Kodkod has had this functionality for some time, it is not explicitly available to the modeller through the Alloy language syntax. We propose an extension to the Alloy language to make partial instances explicitly available to the Alloy user. Explicit partial instances are helpful for the Alloy user in a number of capacities, including test-driven development, regression testing, modelling by example, and combined modelling and meta-modelling. The proposed syntax also gives the modeller explicit access to the performance benefits of Kodkod’s partial instance features.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Test Template Framework (TTF) is a method for model-based testing (MBT) from Z specifications. Although the TTF covers many features of the Z notation, it does not explain how to deal with axiomatic descriptions, quantifiers and set comprehensions. In this paper we extend the TTF so it can process specifications including these features. The techniques presented here may be useful for other MBT methods for the Z notation or for other notations such as Alloy and B, since they use similar mathematical theories.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scientific literature reveals that symbolic representation techniques behind some formal methods are attractive to synthesize parts or verify properties of large discrete event systems. They involve, however, complex encoding schemata and fine tuning heuristic parameters in order to translate specific problems into efficient BDD or SAT-based representations. This approach may be too costly when the main goal is to explore a theory, understand by simulation its underlying concepts and computation procedures, and conduct experiments by applying them to small problems. Based on previous work with Alloy on the synthesis of observers and nonblocking supervisors of a system organized hierarchically with a flat state space estimated to 1031 states, this paper investigates more deeply issues raised with its use in the modeling and prototyping of the supervisory control theory, including the application of models to practical problems. This study was conducted in a broader context than just hierarchical control since it embraces various variants of this theory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a bounded analysis, arithmetic operators become partial, and a different semantics becomes necessary. One approach, mimicking programming languages, is for overflow to result in wrap-around. Although easy to implement, wrap-around produces unexpected counterexamples that do not correspond to cases that would arise in the unbounded setting. This paper describes a new approach, implemented in the latest version of the Alloy Analyzer, in which instances that would involve overflow are suppressed, and consequently, spurious counterexamples are eliminated. The key idea is to interpret quantifiers so that bound variables range only over values that do not cause overflow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Decomposition is a technique to separate the design of a complex system into smaller sub-models, which improves scalability and team development. In the shared-variable decomposition approach for Event-B sub-models share external variables and communicate through external events which cannot be easily refined. Our first contribution hence is a proposal for a new construct called interface that encapsulates the external variables, along with a mechanism for interface instantiation. Using the new construct and mechanism, external variables can be refined consistently. Our second contribution is an approach for verifying the correctness of Event-B extensions using the supporting Rodin tool. We illustrate our approach by proving the correctness of interface instantiation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Refinement is a powerful technique for tackling the complexities that arise when formally modelling systems. Here we focus on a posit-and-prove style of refinement, and specifically where a user requires guidance in order to overcome a failed refinement step. We take an integrated approach – combining the complementary strengths of top-down planning and bottom-up theory formation. In this paper we focus mainly on the planning perspective. Specifically, we propose a new technique called refinement plans which combines both modelling and reasoning perspectives. When a refinement step fails, refinement plans provide a basis for automatically generating modelling guidance by abstracting away from the details of low-level proof failures. The refinement plans described here are currently being implemented for the Event-B modelling formalism, and have been assessed on paper using case studies drawn from the literature. Longer-term, our aim is to identify refinement plans that are applicable to a range of modelling formalisms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Formal development in Event-B generally requires the validation of a large number of proof obligations. Some automatic tools exist to automatically discharge a significant part of them, thus augmenting the efficiency of the formal development. We here investigate the use of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers in addition to the traditional tools, and detail the techniques used for the cooperation between the Rodin platform and SMT solvers. Our contribution is the definition of two approaches to use SMT solvers, their implementation in a Rodin plug-in, and an experimental evaluation on a large sample of industrial and academic projects. Adding SMT solvers to Atelier B provers reduces to one fourth the number of sequents that need to be proved interactively.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The declarative and relational aspects of Alloy make it a desirable language to use for high-level modeling of transition systems. However, currently, these models must be translated to another tool to carry out full temporal logic model checking. In this article, we show how a symbolic representation of the semantics of computational tree logic with fairness constraints (CTLFC) can be written in first-order logic with the transitive closure operator, and therefore described in Alloy. Using this encoding, the question of whether a declarative model of a transition system satisfies a temporal logic formula can be solved using the Alloy Analyzer directly. Also, since a declarative description of a model may actually represent a family of transition systems, we define two distinct model checking questions on this family (existential and universal model checking) and show how these properties can be evaluated in the Alloy Analyzer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Test generation techniques based on model checking suffer from the state space explosion problem. However, for a family of systems that can be easily decomposed in sub-systems, we devise a technique to cope with this problem. To model such systems, we introduce the notion of sequential net of Abstract State Machines (ASMs), which represents a system constituted by a set of ASMs such that only one ASM is active at every time. Given a net of ASMs, we first generate a test suite for every ASM in the net, then we combine the tests in order to obtain a test suite for the entire system. We prove that, under some assumptions, the technique preserves coverage of the entire system. We test our approach on a benchmark and we report a web application example for which we are able to generate complete test suites.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many model-finding tools, such as Alloy, charge users with providing bounds on the sizes of models. It would be preferable to automatically compute sufficient upper-bounds whenever possible. The Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey fragment of first-order logic can relieve users of this burden in some cases: its sentences are satisfiable iff they are satisfied in a finite model, whose size is computable from the input problem. Researchers have observed, however, that the class of sentences for which such a theorem holds is richer in a many-sorted framework—which Alloy inhabits—than in the one-sorted case. This paper studies this phenomenon in the general setting of order-sorted logic supporting overloading and empty sorts. We establish a syntactic condition generalizing the Bernays-Schönfinkel-Ramsey form that ensures the Finite Model Property. We give a linear-time algorithm for deciding this condition and a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the bound on model sizes. As a consequence, model-finding is a complete decision procedure for sentences in this class. Our work has been incorporated into Margrave, a tool for policy analysis, and applies in real-world situations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many high-integrity software development processes prevent any assumptions about the system hardware, but this makes it impossible to use these techniques on software that must interact with the hardware, such as device drivers. This work takes the opposite approach: if the analyst accepts that the analysis will only be valid for a particular target system then the specification of the system can be used to infer the behaviour of the software that interacts with it. An analysis process is developed that operates on disassembled executable files and formal specifications of the target platform to produce CSP-OZ formal models of the software’s behaviour. This analysis process is implemented in a prototype called Spurinna. This is demonstrated in conjunction with the verification tools Z2SAL and the SAL suite to demonstrate the verification of properties of an example program.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Symmetry reduction is a model checking technique that can help alleviate the problem of state space explosion, by preventing redundant state space exploration. In previous work, we have developed three effective approaches to symmetry reduction for B that have been implemented into the ProB model checker, and we have proved the soundness of our state symmetries. However, it is also important to show our techniques are sound with respect to standard model checking, at the algorithmic level. In this paper, we present a retrospective B development that addresses this issue through a series of B refinements. This work also demonstrates the valuable insights into a system that can be gained through formal modelling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Identifying a minimal unsatisfiable core in an Alloy model proved to be a very useful feature in many scenarios. We extend this concept to hot core, an approximation to unsat core that enables the user to obtain valuable feedback when the Alloy’s sat-solving process is abruptly interrupted. We present some use cases that exemplify this new feature and explain the applied heuristics. The NP-completeness nature of the verification problem makes hot core specially appealing, since it is quite frequent for users of the Alloy Analyzer to stop the analysis when some time threshold is exceeded. We provide experimental results showing very promising outcomes supporting our proposal.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The SystemC UML profile is a modeling language designed to lift features and abstractions of the SystemC/C++ class library to the UML level with the aim of improving the current industrial System-on-Chip design methodology. Its graphical syntax and static semantics were defined following the “profile” extension mechanism of the UML metamodel, while its behavioral semantics was given in natural language. This paper provides a precise and executable semantics of the SystemC Process State Machines that are an extension of the UML state machines and are part of the SystemC UML profile to model the reactive behavior of the SystemC processes. To this purpose, we used the meta-hooking approach of the ASM-based semantic framework, which allows the definition of the dynamic semantics of metamodel-based languages and of UML profiles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Smart Card applications usually require reliability and security to avoid incorrect operation or access violation in transactions and corruption or undue access to stored information. A way of reaching these requirements is improving the quality of the development process of these applications. BSmart is a method and a corresponding tool designed to support the formal development of the complete Java Card smart card application, following the B formal method.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents AsmetaSMV, a model checker for Abstract State Machines (ASMs). It has been developed with the aim of enriching the ASMETA (ASM mETAmodeling) toolset – a set of tools for ASMs – with the capabilities of the model checker NuSMV to verify properties of ASM models written in the AsmetaL language. We describe the general architecture of AsmetaSMV and the process of automatically mapping ASM models into NuSMV programs. As a proof of concepts, we report the results of using AsmetaSMV to verify temporal properties of various case studies of different characteristics and complexity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scenario-driven requirement specifications are widely used to capture and represent high-level requirements. Timed Use Case Maps (TUCM) is a high-level scenario based modeling technique that can be used to capture and integrate behavioral and time-related aspects at a high level of abstraction. The Timed Use Case Maps language assumes durational semantics which introduces semantic variation points when dealing with concurrent flows. In this paper, we introduce three AsmL-based operational semantics, making the semantic variation points of TUCM concurrent behavior explicit. The proposed semantics are illustrated using an example.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Software development in B and Event-B generates proof obligations that have to be discharged using theorem provers. The cost of such developments therefore depends directly on the degree of automation and efficiency of theorem proving techniques for the logics in which these lemmas are expressed. This paper presents and formalizes an approach to transform a class of proof obligations generated in the Rodin platform in a language that can be addressed by state-of-the-art SMT solvers. The work presented in the paper handles proof obligations with Booleans, integer arithmetics and basic sets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scenarios have been used in various stages of the software development process, in particular in requirement elicitation and software validation and testing. In this paper, we present our recent work on the specification, design and implementation of a CoreASM plugin, called Bârun, that offers a powerful scripting language on top of the CoreASM extensible modeling framework and tool environment for high-level design and analysis of distributed systems. We illustrate the application of Bârun and demonstrate its features using an industrial case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We investigate the use of ClawZ, a suite of tools for the verification of implementations of control laws, to construct formal models for control systems in the area of communications and signal-processing intensive applications. Whereas ClawZ has been successfully applied to verify control components in avionic systems, special requirements need to be identified and addressed to extend its use to the aforementioned application domain. This gives rise to several extensions, which we explain and subsequently validate by constructing the Z model of a software-defined radio communication device. The experience reported provides insight into general issues surrounding the use and extension of ClawZ.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We study the definition and the mapping of an AADL subset: the so called synchronous subset. We show that the data port protocol used for delayed and immediate connections between periodic threads can be interpreted in a synchronous way. In this paper, we formalize this interpretation and study the development of its mapping such that the original synchronous semantics is preserved. For that purpose, we use refinements through the Event B method.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present here a case study developing a parallel program. The approach that we use combines refinement and decomposition techniques. This involves in the first step to abstractly specify the aim of the program, then subsequently introduce shared information between sub-processes via refinement. Afterwards, decomposition is applied to split the resulting model into sub-models for different processes. These sub-models are later independently developed using refinement. Our approach aids the understanding of parallel programs and reduces the complexity in their proofs of correctness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The topic of access control has received a new lease of life in recent years as the need for assurance that the correct access control policy is in place is seen by many as crucial to providing assurance to individuals that their data is being treated appropriately. This trend is likely to continue with the increase in popularity of social networking sites and shifts to ‘cloud’-like commercial services: in both contexts, a clear statement of “who can do what” to one’s data is key in engendering trust. While approaches such as role-based access control (RBAC) provide a degree of abstraction, therefore increasing manageability and accessibility, policy languages such as the XML-based XACML provide greater degrees of expressibility—and, as a result, increased complexity. In this paper we explore how the mutual benefits of both RBAC and XACML, and Alloy and Z, may be used to best effect. RBAC is used as an accessible conceptual model; XACML is used as a language of implementation. Our concern is to facilitate the construction and reuse of role-based policies, which may subsequently be deployed in terms of XACML. We wish to provide assurance that these representations and transformations are, in some sense, correct. To this end, we consider formal models of both RBAC and XACML in terms of Z. We also describe how we have taken initial steps in utilising the Alloy Analyzer tool to provide a level of assurance that the two representations are consistent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Java programming language has been widely described as secure by design. Nevertheless, a number of serious security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Java, particularly in the component known as the Bytecode Verifier. This paper describes a method for representing Java security constraints using the Alloy modeling language. It further describes a system for performing a security analysis on any block of Java bytecodes by converting the bytes into relation initializers in Alloy. Any counterexamples found by the Alloy analyzer correspond directly to insecure code. Analysis of a real world malicious applet is given to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. This type of analysis represents a significant departure from standard malware detection methods based on signatures or anomaly detection.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents Matelas, a B predicate calculus definition for social networking, modelling social-network content, privacy policies, social-networks friendship relations, and how these relations effect users’ policies. The work presented in this paper is part of an ongoing work that aims at using several formal methods tools and techniques to develop a full-fledged social-network service implementing stipulated policies. Although we employed Atelier B to write Matelas, plans are to port it to Event B and to use Rodin to implement the social-network application.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We propose what is essentially a recasting of Circus, the Z-and-CSP-based concurrent language for refinement, into a B context by means of a modest extension of classical B which introduces a new structural component called a reactive-B process. This specifies the channels via which the process can communicate with its environment, and actions by which its behaviour is specified. Such actions are expressed in a new action notation in the same syntactic spirit as B’s Abstract Machine Notation, but with a similar Unifying Theories of Programming relational semantics to that of the actions of Circus. Crucially, by including ordinary abstract machines these reactive-B processes can also acquire persistent state, which their actions can manipulate by invoking the operations of those included machines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The activities of formal modelling and reasoning are closely related. But while the rigour of building formal models brings significant benefits, formal reasoning remains a major barrier to the wider acceptance of formalism within design. Here we propose reasoned modelling critics – a technique which aims to abstract away from the complexities of low-level proof obligations, and provide high-level modelling guidance to designers when proofs fail. Inspired by proof planning critics, the technique combines proof-failure analysis with modelling heuristics. Here, we present the details of our proposal and outline future plans.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We provide a detailed description of refinement in Event-B, both as a contribution in itself and as a foundation for the approach to simultaneous animation of multiple levels of refinement that we propose. We present an algorithm for simultaneous multi-level animation of refinement, and show how it can be used to detect a variety of errors that occur frequently when using refinement. The algorithm has been implemented in ProB and we applied it to several case studies, showing that multi-level animation is tractable also on larger models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the key research challenges in autonomic computing is to define rigorous mathematical models for specifying, analyzing, and verifying high-level self-* policies. This paper presents the FracToy formal methodology to specify self-configurable component-based systems, and particularly both their component-based architectural description and their self-configuration policies. This rigorous methodology is based on the first-order relational logic, and is implemented with the Alloy formal specification language. The paper presents the different steps of the FracToy methodology and illustrates them on a self-configurable component-based example.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Event-B does not provide specific support for the modelling of problems that require some structuring, such as, local variables or sequential ordering of events. All variables need to be declared globally and sequential ordering of events can only be achieved by abstract program counters. This has two unfortunate consequences: such models become less comprehensible — we have to infer sequential ordering from the use of program counters; proof obligation generation does not consider ordering — generating too many proof obligations (although these are usually trivially discharged). In this article we propose a method for specifying structured models avoiding, in particular, the use of abstract program counters. It uses a notation that mainly serves to drive proof obligation generation. However, the notation also describes the structure of a model explicitly. A corresponding graphical notation is introduced that visualises the structure of a model.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recently, Space Systems Finland has undertaken formal Event B development of a part of the on-board software for the BepiColombo space mission. As a result, lack of modularisation mechanisms in Event B has been identified as a serious obstacle to scalability. One of the main benefits of modularisation is that it allows us to decompose system models into components that can be independently developed. It also helps to manage complexity of models that in the industrial setting are usually very large and difficult to comprehend. On the other hand, modularisation enables reuse of formally developed components in the formal product line development. In this paper we propose a conservative extension of Event B formalism to support modularisation. We demonstrate how our approach can support reuse in the formal development in the space domain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A natural encoding of synchronous message exchange with direct wait-control is proved to be equivalent in a distributed environment to a refinement which uses semaphores to implement wait control. The proof uses a most general scheduler, which is left as abstract and assumed to satisfy a few realistic, explicitly stated assumptions. We hope to provide a scheme that can be implemented by current theorem provers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite the rich literature on network architecture and communication system design, the current practice of describing architectures remains informal and idiosyncratic. Such practice has evolved based on idiomatic terminology and hence, it is failing to provide a formal framework for representing and for reasoning about network architectures. This state of affairs has led to the overloading of architectural terms, and to the emergence of a large body of network architecture proposals with no clear indication of their cross similarities, their compatibility points, their unique properties, and their architectural performance and soundness. Formalizing network architectural descriptions is therefore a timely contribution, and this paper presents a first step in that direction. The paper builds upon architectural style modeling concepts from the software engineering field, and applies them to the network architecture space. Our approach is presented through a case study detailing a formal model for a common class of network architectures. The model uses a simple declarative language based on relations and first-order logic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many authors have drawn parallels between the relational model of data and the formal description technique Z, yet none of these contributions have managed to be both close to the relational model in terms of providing a practical means of database design and fully formal in terms of providing an appropriate metamodel. We compare these various formalisms, and suggest how the use of the formal template approach of Amálio et al might help to overcome some of the issues faced. We demonstrate the application of this work via a short case study, and suggest further enhancements to the template language.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Few tools are available to help with the difficult task of validating that a Z specification captures its intended meaning. One tool that has been proven to be useful for validating specifications is the Alloy Analyzer, an interactive tool for checking and visualising Alloy models. However, Z specifications need to be translated to Alloy notation to make use of the Alloy Analyzer. These translations have been performed manually so far, which is a cumbersome and error-prone activity. The aim of this paper is to explore to what extent this process can be automated. The paper identifies a subset of Z that can be straightforwardly translated to Alloy, and the translation for this subset is formalised. More complex constructs, like schemas, are harder to translate. The paper gives a brief overview of the problems, and discusses alternative translation approaches.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Mondex case study concerns the formal development and verification of an electronic purse protocol. Several groups have worked on its specification and mechanical verification, their solutions being (as were ours previously), either one big step or several steps motivated by the task’s complexity. A new solution is presented that is structured into three refinements, motivated by the three concepts underlying Mondex: a message protocol to transfer money over a lossy medium, protection against replay attacks, and uniqueness of transfers using sequence numbers. We also give an improved proof technique based on our theoretical results on verifying interleaved systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents the AValLa language, a domain-specific modelling language for scenario-based validation of ASM models, and its supporting tool, the AsmetaV validator. They have been developed according to the model-driven development principles as part of the asmeta (ASM mETAmodelling) toolset, a set of tools around ASMs. As a proof-of-concepts, the paper reports the results of the scenario-based validation for the well-known LIFT control case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We propose a formal framework based on the B method, that supports the development of secured smart card applications. Accordingly to the Common Criteria methodology, we start from a formal definition and modelling of security policies, as access control policies. At the end of the development process, smart card applications are implemented in a standardized way, based on both the life cycle of smart card applets and the APDU protocol. In this paper, we define a conformance relationship that aims at establishing how smart card applications can be related to security requirement models. This embraces both the notions of security conformance as well as traceability allowing to relate basic events appearing at the level of applications with abstract security policies. This approach has been developed in the RNTL POSÉ project, involving a smart card issuer, Gemalto.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Belief revision is a key functionality for any intelligent agent being able to perceive pieces of knowledge from its environment and to give back sentences she believes to be true with a certain degree of belief. We report on a refinement of a previous, abstract ASM specification of Condor, a system modeling such an agent, to a fully operational specification implemented in AsmL. The complete AsmL implementation of various belief revision operators is presented, demonstrating how using AsmL enabled a high-level implementation that minimizes the gap between the abstract specification of the underlying concepts and the executable code in the implemented system. Based on ASM refinement and verification concepts, a full mathematical correctness proof for different belief revision operators realized in Condor@AsmL is given.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In 2004, the UK Computing Research Committee initiated a number of Grand Challenges aimed at stimulating long term research in key areas of computing science. One of the challenges (GC6) focuses on Dependable Systems Evolution. GC6 has two central principles: theory should be embodied in tools, and tools should be tested against real systems. The goal is to produce a Verifying Compiler (a suite of integrated tools) and a repository of verified software.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As part of our work on the formal analysis of object-oriented models, we turn to systems where many autonomous individuals interact to give rise to complex collective behaviour. We adapt our ZOO [1,2] structuring and apply it to a case study based on a published model of part of the immune system [3]. The formalisation calls for a bottom-up solution with no central control over individual units, and includes an approach to represent feedback channels enabling broadcast communication between individuals and across levels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present in this paper a way to produce test suites for the POSIX mini-challenge, based on a formal model of a file system manager, written using a B machine. By this case study, we illustrate the limitations of a fully-automated testing process, which justifies the use of scenarios that complements the classical functional testing approach. Scenarios are expressed through schemas, focusing only on operation chaining. They are played on the model using a symbolic animation engine in order to automatically compute pertinent operation parameter values, based on model coverage criteria such as behavioral or data coverage. We concretize our experimentation by testing the POSIX conformance of two different file systems: a recent Linux distribution, and a customized Java implementation of POSIX used to evaluate the relevance of our approach.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper introduces an approach to apply data flow testing techniques to Abstract State Machines specifications. Since traditional data flow coverage criteria are strictly based on the mapping between a program and its flow graph, they cannot be directly applied to ASMs. In this context we are interested in tracing the flow of data between states in ASM runs as opposed to between nodes in a program’s flow graph. Therefore, we revise the classical concepts in data flow analysis and define them on two levels: the syntactic (rule) level, and the computational (run) level. We also specify a family of ad hoc data flow coverage criteria and introduce a model checking-based approach to generate automatically test cases satisfying a given set of coverage criteria from ASM models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an approach to model checking abstract state machines (ASMs) without the need for translation of the ASM specification into the modeling language of an existing model checker. Instead, our model checker [mc]square uses the simulation capabilities of CoreASM to build the state space, thereby directly supporting ASMs and circumventing a possible loss of expressiveness in a translation process. This enables our approach to present counterexamples and witnesses directly as sequences of ASM states and at the same time supports the major features of CoreASM like distributed ASMs, n-ary functions or extended rule forms. We show the applicability of this approach in a case study that also reveals possible improvements desirable for minimizing the duration needed for building the state space and its memory consumption.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper describes the formal modeling and analysis of a design for a flash-based filesystem in Alloy. We model the basic operations of a filesystem as well as features that are crucial to NAND flash hardware, such as wear-leveling and erase-unit reclamation. In addition, we address the issue of fault tolerance by modeling a mechanism for recovery from interrupted filesystem operations due to unexpected power loss. We analyze the correctness of our flash filesystem model by checking trace inclusion against a POSIX-compliant abstract filesystem, in which a file is modeled simply as an array of data elements. The analysis is fully automatic and complete within a finite scope.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper is about generating tests from test purposes, in addition to structural tests. We present a method that re-uses a behavioural model and an abstract test concretization layer developed for structural testing, and relies on additional test purposes. We propose, in the B framework, a process of test generation that uses the symbolic animation mechanisms of LTG (Leirios Test Generator) based on constraint solving, and guided by the test purposes. We build for that a B animable model that is the synchronized product of a behavioural B abstract model and a test purpose described as a labelled transition system. We prove the correctness of this method, and illustrate it by means of the IAS case study. IAS is a smart-card application dedicated to the operations of Identification, Authentication and electronic Signature.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ingredients of typical model based development via refinement are re-examined, and some well known frameworks are reviewed in that light, drawing out commonalities and differences. It is observed that alterations in semantics take place de facto due to applications pressures and for other reasons. This leads to a perspective on tools for such methods in which the proof obligations become programmable and/or configurable, permitting easier co-operation between techniques and interaction with an Evidential Tool Bus. This is of intrinsic interest, and also relevant to the Verification Grand Challenge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We address the proof-based development of cryptographic protocols satisfying security properties. Communication channels are supposed to be unsafe. Analysing cryptographic protocols requires precise modelling of the attacker’s knowledge. In this paper we use the event B modelling language to model the knowledge of the attacker for a class of cryptographic protocols called cascade protocols. The attacker’s behaviour conforms to the Dolev-Yao model. In the Dolev-Yao model, the attacker has full control of the communication channel, and the cryptographic primitives are supposed to be perfect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Event-B is a formal modelling method which is claimed to be suitable for diverse modelling domains, such as reactive systems and sequential program development. This claim hinges on the fact that any particular model has an appropriate semantics. In Event-B this semantics is provided implicitly by proof obligations associated with a model. There is no fixed semantics though. In this article we argue that this approach is beneficial to modelling because we can use similar proof obligations across a variety of modelling domains. By way of two examples we show how similar proof obligations are linked to different semantics. A small set of proof obligations is thus suitable for a whole range of modelling problems in diverse modelling domains.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a novel formal development of a non-trivial parallel program: Simpson’s implementation of asynchronous communication mechanisms (ACMs). Although the correctness of the “4-slot algorithm” has been shown elsewhere, earlier developments are by no means intuitive. The aims of this paper include both the presentation of an understandable (yet formal) design history and the establishment of another way of “splitting (software) atoms”. Using the “fiction of atomicity” as an aid to understanding the initial steps of development, the top-level specification is developed to code. The rely-guarantee approach is, here, combined with notions of read/write frames and “phased” specifications; the atomicity assumptions implied by rely/guarantee conditions are realised by clever choice of data representation. The development method herein is compared with other approaches –in a spirit of cooperation– as the authors believe that constructive comparison elucidates many of the finer points in the “4-slot” specification/development and of parallel programs in general.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The transition from classical B [2] to the Event-B language and method [3] has seen the removal of some forms of model structuring and composition, with the intention of reinventing them in future. This work contributes to that reinvention. Inspired by a proposed method for state-based decomposition and refinement [5] of an Event-B model, we propose a familiar parallel event composition (over disjoint state variable lists), and the less familiar event fusion (over intersecting state variable lists). A brief motivation is provided for these and other forms of composition of models, in terms of feature-based modelling. We show that model consistency is preserved under such compositions. More significantly we show that model composition preserves refinement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We propose a syntactic extension of Event-B incorporating a limited notion of obligation described by triggers. The trigger of an event is the dual of the guard: when a guard is not true, an event must not occur, whereas when a trigger is true, the event must occur. The obligation imposed by a trigger is interpreted as a constraint on when the other events are permitted. For example, the simplest trigger next, which states that the event must be the next one to be executed when the trigger becomes true, is modelled as an extra guard on each of the other events which prohibits their execution at this time. In this paper we describe the modelling of triggers in Event-B, and analyse refinement and abstract scheduling of triggered events.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>UseCase-wise Development, the introduction of functionality into an application in stages, with each stage being carried through to (ideally) implementation before the next is considered, is examined with a view to its being treated via an Event-B methodology. The need to modify top level behaviour in a non-skip way precludes its naive treatment via Event-B refinement, and paves the way for the use of retrenchment in Event-B. The details of an Event-B formulation of retrenchment, aligned to the practical details of the Rodin toolset, are described. The details of refinement/retrenchment interworking needed to handle UseCase-wise development are outlined, and a simple case study is given.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A Virtual Machine (VM) is a program running on a conventional microprocessor that emulates the binary instruction set, registers, and memory space of an idealized computing machine, a well-known example being the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Despite there being many binary Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) in existence, all share a set of core properties which have been tailored to their particular applications. An abstract model may capture these generic properties and be subsequently refined to a particular machine, providing a reusable template for development of formally proven ISAs: this is a task to which the EventB [16,18] notation is well suited. This paper describes a project to use the RODIN tool-set [24] to perform such a process, ultimately producing the MIDAS (Microprocessor Instruction and Data Abstraction System) VM, capable of running binary executables compiled from high-level languages such as C [9]. The abstract model is incrementally refined to a model capable of automatic translation to C source code, and compilation for a hardware platform using a standard compiler. A second C compiler, targeted to the VM itself, allows C programs to be executed on it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper we discuss our progress towards building a model-checker for Z. The approach we take in our Z2SAL project involves implementing a translation from Z into the SAL input language, upon which the SAL toolset can be applied. The toolset includes a number of model-checkers together with a simulator. In this paper we discuss our progress towards implementing as complete as a translation as possible, the limitations we have reached and the optimizations we have made. We illustrate with a small example.&lt;/p>
