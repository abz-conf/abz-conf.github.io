<h2><a href=/publication/braghinlr21/>Towards ASM-Based Automated Formal Verification of Security Protocols</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In the security protocols domain, formal verification is more and more highly demanded to guarantee security assurance: humans increasingly depend on the use of connected devices in their daily life, so they must be protected against possible threats and accidents.

<h2><a href=/publication/lihdgs21/>Unbounded Barrier-Synchronized Concurrent ASMs for Effective MapReduce Processing on Streams</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract MapReduce supports the processing of large data sets in parallel. It has been shown that MapReduce is an example for the use of the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) bridging model, a model for parallel computation on a fixed set of processors comprising alternating computation and communication phases.

<h2><a href=/publication/vulm21/>Validation of Formal Models by Timed Probabilistic Simulation</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The validation of a formal model consists of checking its conformance with actual requirements. In the context of (Event-) B, some temporal aspects can typically be validated by LTL or CTL model checking, while other properties can be validated via interactive animation or trace replay.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/dghaymhbhas21/>Verifying System-Level Security of a Smart Ballot Box</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Event-B, a refinement-based formal modelling language, has traditionally focused on safety, but now increasingly finds a new role in developing secure systems. In this paper we take a fresh look at security and focus on what security means for the system rather than looking at detailed protocols.

<h2><a href=/publication/borgers20/>A Characterization of Distributed ASMs with Partial-Order Runs</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract To overcome the practical limitations of partial-order runs of ‘distributed ASMs’ (Abstract State Machines) proposed by Gurevich, we have defined a concept of concurrent runs of multi-agent ASMs and could show that concurrent ASMs capture a natural language-independent axiomatic definition of concurrent algorithms, thus generalising Gurevich’s seminal ‘Sequential ASM Thesis’ from sequential to concurrent algorithms.

<h2><a href=/publication/bougacha20/>A Formal Approach for the Modeling of High-Level Architectures Aligned with System Requirements</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract IRT Railenium ( http://railenium.eu/fr/) is a test and applied research center for the rail industry in France. One of its three R&D and innovation programs aims in particular to provide the technological tools and bricks necessary for the development of the Autonomous Train.

<h2><a href=/publication/mendil20/>A Framework for Critical Interactive System Formal Modelling and Analysis</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Interactive system development does not follow the same life cycle as other system developments. The essential differences lie in the iterative nature of such system development. Throughout iterations, the requirements undergo many changes due to the evolution of customer’s needs and user feedback after experiencing prototypes.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/schewef20/>A Logic for Reflective ASMs</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Reflective algorithms are algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. Recently a behavioural theory of reflective algorithms has been developed, which shows that they are captured by reflective abstract state machines (rASMs).

<h2><a href=/publication/dunkelausl20/>Analysing ProB&amp;apos;s Constraint Solving Backends - What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let&amp;apos;s Find Out</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different backends of the ProB constraint solver. For this, we train a random forest over a database of constraints to classify whether a backend is able to find a solution within a given amount of time or answers unknown.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/grall20/>Automatic Generation of DistAlgo Programs from Event-B Models</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The development of distributed algorithms offers challenges in verifying that they meet their specifications. The correct-by-construction approach consists in developing a model of the algorithm before transforming this model into a program.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/clarisoc20/>Diverse Scenario Exploration in Model Finders Using Graph Kernels and Clustering</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Complex software systems can be described using modeling notations such as UML/OCL or Alloy. Then, some correctness properties of these systems can be checked using model finders, which compute sample scenarios either fulfilling the desired properties or illustrating potential faults.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/benyagoubas20/>Event-B-Supported Choreography-Defined Communicating Systems - Correctness and Completeness</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Choreographies prescribe the rendez-vous synchronisation of messages in a communicating system. Such a system is called realisable, if the traces of the prescribed communication coincide with those of the asynchronous system of peers, where the communication channels either use FIFO queues or multiset mailboxes.

<h2><a href=/publication/kraibi20/>Event-B: From Systems to Sub-systems Modeling</a></h2>

<h2><a href=/publication/stankaitisikair20/>Formal Distributed Protocol Development for Reservation of Railway Sections</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The decentralisation of railway signalling systems has the potential to increase railway network capacity, availability and reduce maintenance costs. Given the safety-critical nature of railway signalling and the complexity of novel distributed signalling solutions, their safety should be guaranteed by using thorough system validation methods.

<h2><a href=/publication/jahaniancr20/>Formal Verification of Interoperability Between Future Network Architectures Using Alloy</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The Internet is composed of many interconnected, interoperating networks. With the recent advances in Future Internet design, multiple new network architectures, especially Information-Centric Networks (ICN) have emerged. Given the ubiquity of networks based on the Internet Protocol (IP), it is likely that we will have a number of different interconnecting network domains with different architectures, including ICNs.

<h2><a href=/publication/lecomte20/>Programming the CLEARSY Safety Platform with B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The CLEARSY Safety Platform (CSSP) is aimed at easing the development and the deployment of safety critical applications, up to the safety integrity level 4 (SIL4). It relies on the smart integration of the B formal method, redundant code generation and compilation, and a hardware platform that ensures a safe execution of the software.

<h2><a href=/publication/kukovectk18/>Extracting Symbolic Transitions from TLA+ Specifications</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In (\textsc {TLA}^{+}), a system specification is written as a logical formula that restricts the system behavior. As a logic, (\textsc {TLA}^{+}) does not have assignments and other imperative statements that are used by model checkers to compute the successor states of a system state.

<h2><a href=/publication/banach18/>Issues in Automated Urban Train Control: &amp;apos;Tackling&amp;apos; the Rugby Club Problem</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Normally, the passengers on urban rail systems remain fairly stationary, allowing for a relatively straightforward approach to controlling the dynamics of the system, based on the total rest mass of the train and passengers.

<h2><a href=/publication/dupontaps18/>Proof-Based Approach to Hybrid Systems Development: Dynamic Logic and Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The design of hybrid systems controllers requires one to handle both discrete and continuous functionalities in a single development framework. In this paper, we propose the design and verification of such controllers using a correct-by-construction approach.
