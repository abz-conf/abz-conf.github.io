<h2><a href=/publication/brunelccm23/>Adding Records to Alloy</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Records are a composite data type available in most programming and specification languages, but they are not natively supported by Alloy. As a consequence, users often find themselves having to simulate records in ad hoc ways, a strategy that is error prone and often encumbers the analysis procedures.

<h2><a href=/publication/ferrarottis23/>Behavioural Theory of Reflective Algorithms</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This “journal-first” paper presents a summary of the behavioural theory of reflective sequential algorithms (RSAs), i.e. sequential algorithms that can modify their own behaviour. The theory comprises a set of language-independent postulates defining the class of RSAs, an abstract machine model, and the proof that all RSAs are captured by this machine model.
</div>

</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/barradasbd20/>Existence Proof Obligations for Constraints, Properties and Invariants in Atelier B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Proof obligations of the B method and of Event B use predicates in the Constraints, Sets, Properties and Invariant clauses as hypotheses in proof obligations. A contradiction in these predicates results in trivially valid proof obligations and essentially voids the development.
</div>

<h2><a href=/publication/paulweberpz20/>Structuring the State and Behavior of ASMs: Introducing a Trait-Based Construct for Abstract State Machine Languages</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known state-based formal method to analyze, verify, and specify software and hardware systems. Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications.

</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/kornerld20/>Towards a Shared Specification Repository</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Many formal methods research communities lack a shared set of benchmarks. As a result, many research articles in the past have evaluated new techniques on specifications that are specifically tailored to the problem or not publicly available.
</div>
</div>
