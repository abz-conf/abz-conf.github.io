<h2><a href=/publication/kobayashiih14/>Understanding and Planning Event-B Refinement through Primitive Rationales</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Event-B provides a promising feature of refinement to gradually construct a comprehensive specification of a complex system including various aspects. It has unique difficulties to design complexity mitigation, while obeying Event-B consistency rules, among the potentially large possibilities of refinement plans.

<h2><a href=/publication/zenzarogs14/>WebASM: An Abstract State Machine Execution Environment for the Web</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We describe WebASM, a web-based environment that embeds the CoreASM execution engine in a web page. WebASM provides several advantages to specification writers: (1) complex behaviour expressed via ASM can be made visible by using the full power of the web-based presentation layer; (2) ASM specifications can be edited and run interactively via any web browser; (3) the full CoreASM environment is made available via zero-install deployment, thus eliminating a major barrier to the adoption of the language.

<h2><a href=/publication/sulskusp12/>A Pattern for Modelling Fault Tolerant Systems in Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Formal methods are used for the specification and verification of software and hardware systems. One class of systems interacts with the outside world through sensors and actuators, and may include nondeterminism from hardware faults or environmental inputs, making modelling more complex.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/sousass12/>A Practical Event-B Refinement Method Based on a UML-Driven Development Process</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Event-B is a formal method that allows flexible modelling and refinement of systems. However, it is hard to convince developers to adopt it because they are not used to mathematical models and it doesn’t provide any practical refinement method.
</div>

<h2><a href=/publication/mirandolaps12/>A Reliability Prediction Method for Abstract State Machines</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract According to the vision of Design for Reliability, software reliability has to be considered in all the activities within the software development life cycle. In particular, writing formal specifications, like other activities in software development, is error-prone, especially for large-scale systems.
</div>
</div>

<h2><a href=/publication/schewew12/>A Simplified Parallel ASM Thesis</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We present an idea how to simplify Gurevich’s parallel ASM thesis. The key idea is to modify only the bounded exploration postulate from the sequential ASM thesis by allowing also non-ground comprehension terms.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/lezuok12/>A Unified Processor Model for Compiler Verification and Simulation Using ASM</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract For safety critical embedded systems the correctness of the processor, toolchain and compiler is an important issue. Translation validation is one approach for compiler verification. A common semantic framework to represent source and target language is needed and Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are a well suited and established method.
</div>

<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/banachzsw12b/>Continuous Behaviour in Event-B: A Sketch</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Including provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as discrete state change is considered for Event-B. An extension of Event-B is sketched that accommodates continuous events (called pliant events) in between familiar discrete events (called mode events).
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/edmundsbmsl12/>Event-B Code Generation: Type Extension with Theories</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The Event-B method is a formal modelling approach; our interest is the final step, of generating code for concurrent programs, from Event-B. Our Tasking Event-B tool integrates Event-B to facilitate code generation.

<h2><a href=/publication/barbosad12/>Formal Verification of PLC Programs Using the B Method</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In this paper we propose an approach to verify PLC programs, a common platform to control systems in the industry. Programs written in the languages of the IEC 61131-3 standard are automatically translated to B machines and are then amenable to formal analysis of safety constraints and general structural properties of the application.

<h2><a href=/publication/luzzanarrs12/>Modeling Synchronization/Communication Patterns in Vision-Based Robot Control Applications Using ASMs</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This paper proposes the use of the Abstract State Machine method for a rigorous foundation in modeling and validating Vision-Based Robot Control applications. We show how to tailor control tasks definitions and associated synchronization/communication patterns in rigorous and abstract terms by using control state ASMs and an extension of the classical flowchart notation to allow the definition/instantiation of recurring design solutions and to improve model traceability.

<h2><a href=/publication/sorgepb10/>A Basis for Feature-Oriented Modelling in Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Feature-oriented modelling is a well-known approach for Software Product Line (SPL) development. It is a widely used method when developing groups of related software. With an SPL approach, the development of a software product is quicker, less expensive and of higher quality than a one-off development since much effort is re-used.
</div>

<h2><a href=/publication/shaogkp10/>A Case for Using Data-Flow Analysis to Optimize Incremental Scope-Bounded Checking</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In software verification, scope-bounded checking of programs has become an effective technique for finding subtle bugs. Given bounds (that are iteratively relaxed) on input size and length of execution paths, a program and its correctness specifications are translated into a formula, which is solved using off-the-shelf solvers – a solution to the formula is a counterexample to the correctness specification.

<h2><a href=/publication/ait-sadounea10/>A Proof Based Approach for Formal Verification of Transactional BPEL Web Services</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) are increasingly used in various application domains. Nowadays various Services operate on the Web and access various critical resources such as databases. These services are called transactional web services when they perform transactional actions.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/bagheris10/>Architecture as an Independent Variable for Aspect-Oriented Application Descriptions</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Software architecture researchers have long assumed that architecture independent application descriptions can be mapped to architectures in many styles, that results vary in quality attributes, and that the choice of a style is driven by consideration of such attributes.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/julliandsbm10/>B Model Abstraction Combining Syntactic and Semantic Methods</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In a model-based testing approach as well as for the verification of properties by model-checking, B models provide an interesting solution. But for industrial applications, the size of their state space often makes them hard to handle.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/michelgv10/>B-ASM: Specification of ASM à la B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We aim at extending the B language in order to build ASM programs which are correct with respect to B-like logical specifications. On the one hand, the main strengths of the B formal method are: i) the ability to express logical statements, and ii) the construction of a correct implementation by refinement.
