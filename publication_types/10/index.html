<h2><a href=/publication/armbrusterk24/>Meta-programming Event-B - Advancing Tool Support and Language Extensions</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Transforming models based on their textual representation is a cumbersome task. This is particularly the case for Event-B, where the predominant representation is a set of XML files. As a consequence, tool support is lacking, even for minor refactoring operations.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/jacquot24/>Multi-model Animation with JeB</a></h2>

<h2><a href=/publication/iglerm24/>ThoR: An Alloy5-Like DSL for Interactive Theorem Proving in Coq</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The steep learning curve associated with interactive theorem proving poses a significant entry barrier for the learner. While the Alloy specification language [1] has simplified the introduction to and application of formal methods, transitioning to interactive theorem proving, such as with Coq [2], remains daunting due to the inherent complexity of formal reasoning and the sophisticated tooling required.
