&lt;p>Complementary to the systems and software focus of the conference, this presentation will be about chips and the progress that has been made in their functional verification. Common ground will be high-level, still cycleaccurate, state-based models of hardware functionalities called Abstract RT. RT stands for register transfer descriptions of hardware such as VHDL or Verilog. An Abstract RT model is a formal specification which permits an automated formal comparison with its implementation, thus detecting any functional discrepancy between code and formal specification. The first part of the presentation will sketch the big picture: Moore‘s Law still holds and permits building huge chips comprising up to hundreds of millions of gates. Under the constraints of shrinking budgets and development times, these so-called systems-on-chip (SoC) can no longer be developed from scratch but must largely be assembled from pre-designed, pre-verified design components such as processors, controllers, a plethora of peripherals and large amounts of memories. Therefore, getting a SoC right depends to a large extent on the quality of these design components - IP for short. At stake are critical errors making it into silicon. These may cost millions of Euros due to delayed market entry, additional engineering and re-production efforts. Hence, the lion’s share of today’s verification efforts goes into the functional verification of such IP.&lt;/p>
