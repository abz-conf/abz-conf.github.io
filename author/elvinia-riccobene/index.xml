&lt;p>Blockchain has shown to be a versatile technology with applications ranging from financial services and supply chain management to healthcare, identity verification, etc. Thanks to the usage of smart contracts, blockchain can streamline and automate complex processes, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing administrative overhead. Smart contracts often handle valuable assets and execute critical functions, making them attractive targets for attackers. Thus, secure and reliable smart contracts are necessary. The long-term research we present aims to face the problem of safety and security assurance of smart contracts at design time. We are investigating the usage of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method for the specification, validation, and verification of Ethereum smart contracts. We provide (i) a set of ASM libraries that simplify smart contracts modeling, (ii) models of malicious contracts to be used to check the robustness of a contract against some given attacks, (iii) patterns of properties to be checked to guarantee the operational correctness of the contract and its adherence to certain predefined properties.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the increasing complexity and scale of software-intensive systems, model-based system development requires composable system models and composition operators. In line with such a vision, this paper describes our experience in modeling the behavior of the MVM-Adapt, an adaptive version of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano that has been designed, certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic for treating pneumonia. To keep the complexity of the requirements and models under control, we exploited a compositional modeling technique for discrete-event systems based on Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Essentially, separate ASMs represent the behavior of interacting subsystems of the MVM with their new adaptive functionalities; they can communicate with each other through I/O events, and co-operate by a precise orchestration schema.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the security protocols domain, formal verification is more and more highly demanded to guarantee security assurance: humans increasingly depend on the use of connected devices in their daily life, so they must be protected against possible threats and accidents. However, formal verification, and in general the use of formal methods, is slowed by myths and misconceptions, mainly due to their mathematical base, which discourages many designers or engineers from their adoption. In this paper, we pose the basis for the long-term development of an ASM-based user-friendly framework for the formal verification of security protocols. We introduce a mathematical-based set of templates to formalise common patterns in security protocols and a set of security properties. These templates facilitate the protocol formal verification by providing built-in functions and domains, as well as transition rules and property schema, to be customised according to the specific protocol to be verified. The effectiveness of this approach is shown by means of their application to a number of well-known cryptographic security protocols.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the context of automotive domain, modern control systems are software-intensive and have adaptive features to provide safety and comfort. These software-based features demand software engineering approaches and formal methods that are able to guarantee correct operation, since malfunctions may cause harm/damage. Adaptive Exterior Light and the Speed Control Systems are examples of software-intensive systems that equip modern cars. We have used the Abstract State Machines to model the behaviour of both control systems. Each model has been developed through model refinement, following the incremental way in which functional requirements are given. We used the asmeta tool-set to support the simulation of the abstract models, their validation against the informal requirements, and the verification of behavioural properties. In this paper, we discuss our modelling, validation and verification strategies, and the results (in terms of features addressed and not) of our activities. In particular, we provide insights on how we addressed the adaptive features (the adaptive high beam headlights and the adaptive cruise control) by explicitly modelling their software control loops according to the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) reference control model for self-adaptive systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients. Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper takes advantage of the Hemodialysis machine case study to present a formal development process supporting most of the engineering activities required by the standards, and provides rigorous approaches for system validation and verification. The process is based on the Abstract State Machine formal method and its model refinement principle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The paper presents an Abstract State Machine (ASM) specification of the Landing Gear System case study, and shows how the ASMETA framework can be used to support the modeling and analysis (validation and verification) activities for developing a rigorous and correct model in terms of ASMs. We exploit the two fundamental concepts of the ASM method, i.e., the notion of ground model and the refinement principle, and we achieve model development and model analysis by the combined use of formal methods for specification and for verification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Formal specifications are widely used in the development of safety critical systems, as the Sensor Voting Module of the Landing Gear System. However, the conformance relationship between the formal specification and the concrete implementation must be checked.

&lt;p>The SystemC UML profile is a modeling language designed to lift features and abstractions of the SystemC/C++ class library to the UML level with the aim of improving the current industrial System-on-Chip design methodology. Its graphical syntax and static semantics were defined following the “profile” extension mechanism of the UML metamodel, while its behavioral semantics was given in natural language. This paper provides a precise and executable semantics of the SystemC Process State Machines that are an extension of the UML state machines and are part of the SystemC UML profile to model the reactive behavior of the SystemC processes. To this purpose, we used the meta-hooking approach of the ASM-based semantic framework, which allows the definition of the dynamic semantics of metamodel-based languages and of UML profiles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents AsmetaSMV, a model checker for Abstract State Machines (ASMs). It has been developed with the aim of enriching the ASMETA (ASM mETAmodeling) toolset – a set of tools for ASMs – with the capabilities of the model checker NuSMV to verify properties of ASM models written in the AsmetaL language. We describe the general architecture of AsmetaSMV and the process of automatically mapping ASM models into NuSMV programs. As a proof of concepts, we report the results of using AsmetaSMV to verify temporal properties of various case studies of different characteristics and complexity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents the AValLa language, a domain-specific modelling language for scenario-based validation of ASM models, and its supporting tool, the AsmetaV validator. They have been developed according to the model-driven development principles as part of the asmeta (ASM mETAmodelling) toolset, a set of tools around ASMs. As a proof-of-concepts, the paper reports the results of the scenario-based validation for the well-known LIFT control case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SystemC (built upon C++) [2] is an IEEE industry-standard language for system-level models, specifically targeted at architectural, algorithmic, transaction-level modelling. Recently, a further improvement has been achieved by trying to combine SystemC with lightweight software modelling languages like UML to describe system specifications. In accordance with the design principles of the OMG’s Model-driven architecture (MDA), we defined a model-driven design methodology for embedded systems [3] based on the UML 2, a SystemC UML profile (for the HW side), and a multi-thread C UML profile (for the SW side), which allows UML modelling of the system at higher levels of abstraction (from a functional level down to RTL level).&lt;/p>
