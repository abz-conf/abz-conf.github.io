&lt;p>In this paper, we present a formal Event-B model of the Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV), the case study provided by the ABZ’24 conference. This system aims at helping patients maintain good breathing by providing mechanical ventilation. For this purpose, two modes are possible: Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). In the former mode, respiratory cycles are completely defined by the patient that is able to start breathing on its own. In the latter mode, the respiratory cycle is constant and controlled by the ventilator. Let us note that it is possible to move from a given mode to the other depending on the breathing capabilities of the patient under ventilation. In this paper, we illustrate the use of a correct-by-construction approach, the Event-B formal method and its refinement process, for the formal modeling and the verification of such a complex and critical system. The development of the formal models has been achieved under the Rodin platform that provides us with automatic and interactive provers used to verify the correctness of the models. We have also validated the built Event-B models using the ProB animator/model checker.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The present paper describes an Event-B model of the Arrival MANager system (called AMAN), the case study provided by the ABZ’23 conference. The goal of this safety critical interactive system is to schedule the arrival times of aircraft at airports. This system includes two parts: an autonomous part which predicts the arrival time of an aircraft from external sources (flight plan information, radar and weather information, etc.) and an interface part that permits to the Air Traffic Controller (ATCo) to submit requests to AMAN like changes regarding the arrival times of aircraft. To formally model and verify this critical system, we use a correct-by-construction approach with the Event-B formal method and its refinement process. We mainly consider functional features of the case study; all proof obligations have been discharged using the provers of the Rodin platform under which we carried out our development. To help users understand how AMAN works and its main functionalities, a visualisation of the Event-B models was achieved using the VisB component of ProB. Our models have been validated using ProB by applying scenarios related to different functional aspects of the system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper introduces an Event-B formal model of the adaptive exterior light system for cars, a case study proposed in the context of the ABZ2020 conference. The system describes the different provided lights and the conditions under which they are switched on/off in order to improve the visibility of the driver without dazzling the oncoming ones. The system can be viewed as a lights controller that reads different information form the available sensors (key state, exterior luminosity, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the lights in order to ensure a good visibility for the driver according to the information read. Our model is built using stepwise refinement with the Event-B method. We consider all the features of the case study, all proof obligations have been discharged using the rodin provers. Our model has been validated using ProB by applying the different provided scenarios. This validation has permitted us to point out and correct some mistakes, ambiguities and oversights in the first versions of the case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The present paper presents our proposal of an Event-B model of a speed control system, a part of the case study provided in the ABZ2020 conference. The case study describes how the system regulates the current speed of a car according to a set criteria like the speed desired by the driver, the position of a possible preceding vehicle but also a given speed limit that the driver must not exceed. For that purpose, this controller reads different information form the available sensors (key state, desired speed, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the car&amp;rsquo;s speed according to the read information. To formally model this system, we adopt a stepwise refinement approach with the Event-B method. We consider most features of the case study, all proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers. Our model has been validated using ProB by applying the different provided scenarios. This validation has permitted us to point out and correct some mistakes, ambiguities and oversights contained in the first versions of the case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hybrid systems are one of the most common mathematical models for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). They combine discrete dynamics represented by state machines or finite automata with continuous behaviors represented by differential equations. The measurement of continuous behaviors is performed by sensors. When these sensors have a continuous access to these measurements, we call such model an Event-Triggered model. The properties of this model are easier to prove, while its implementation is difficult in practice. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce a more realistic model, called Time-Triggered model, where the sensors take periodic measurements. Contrary to Event-Triggered models, Time-Triggered models are much easier to implement, but much more difficult to verify. Based on the differential refinement logic (dR(\mathcal {L})), a dynamic logic for refinement relations on hybrid systems, it is possible to prove that a Time-Triggered model refines an Event-Triggered model. The major limitation of such logic is that it is not supported by any prover. In this paper, we propose a correct-by-construction approach that implements the reasoning on hybrid programs particularly the reasoning of dR(\mathcal {L}) in Event-B to take advantage of its associated tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an Event-B model of the ABZ2018 case study on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard. The case study focusses on the management of fixed virtual sub-sections (VSS). We model the hybrid level 3 of the standard, which assumes that trains may be either equipped with an on-board train integrity monitoring system (TIMS) and that they report their position and integrity, ERTMS trains not fitted with TIMS that report only their front position or non-ERTMS trains that do not report any information about their position. We take into account most of the main features of the case study. Our model is decomposed into four refinements. All proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers, except those related to the computation of the VSS state machine, which was found to be ambiguous (nondeterministic). Our model has been validated using ProB. The main safety property, which is that ERTMS trains do not collide, is proved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a specification of the hybrid ERTMS/ETCS level 3 standard in the framework of the case study proposed for the 6th edition of the ABZ conference. The specification is based on the method and tools, developed in the ANR FORMOSE project, for the modeling and formal verification of critical and complex system requirements. The requirements are specified with SysML/KAOS goal diagrams and are automatically translated into B System specifications, in order to obtain the architecture of the formal specification. Domain properties are specified by ontologies with the SysML/KAOS domain modeling language, based on OWL and PLIB. Their automatic translation completes the structural part of the formal specification. The only part of the specification, which must be manually completed, is the body of events. The construction is incremental, based on the refinement mechanisms existing within the involved methods. The formal specification of the case study is composed of seven refinement levels and all the proofs have been discharged with the Rodin prover.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper is about the extension of the SysML/KAOS requirements engineering method with domain models expressed as ontologies. More precisely, it concerns the translation of these ontologies into B System for system construction. The contributions of this paper are twofold. The first one is a formal semantics for the ontology modeling language. The second one is the formal definition of translation rules between ontologies and B system specifications in order to provide the structural part of the formal specification. These translation rules are modeled in Event-B. Their consistency and completeness are proved using Rodin. We show that they are structure preserving (two related elements within the source model remain related within the target model), by proving various isomorphisms between the ontology and the B System specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper describes the Event-B modeling of the landing gear system of an aircraft whose the complete description can be found in [3]. This real-life case study has been proposed by the ABZ’2014 track that takes place in Toulouse, the European capital of the aeronautic industry. Our modeling is based on the Parnas and Madey’s 4-Variable Model that permits to consider the different parts of a system. These parts are incremently introduced using the Event-B refinement technique. The entire development has been carried out under the Rodin toolset. To validate and prove the different components, we use the Atelier B, SMT and ML provers which are plugged to Rodin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We validate the RBAC ANSI 2012 standard using the B method. Numerous problems are identified: logical errors, inconsistencies, ambiguities, typing errors, missing preconditions, invariant violation, inappropriate specification notation. A clean version of the standard written in the B notation is proposed. We argue that the ad hoc mathematical notation used in the standard is inappropriate and we propose that a more methodological and tool-supported approach must definitely be used for writing standards, in order to avoid the issues identified in the paper. Human reviewing is insufficient to produce error-free international standards.&lt;/p>
