&lt;p>Efficient reuse is a goal of many software engineering strategies and is useful in the safety-critical domain where formal development is required. Event-B can be used to develop safety-critical systems, but could be improved by a component-based reuse strategy. In this paper, we outline a component-based reuse methodology for Event-B. It provides a means for bottom-up scalability, and can also be used with the existing top-down approach. We describe the process of creating library components, their composition, and specification of new properties (involving the composed elements). We introduce Event-B component interfaces and propose to use a diagrammatic representation of component instances (based on iUML-B) which can be used to describe the relationships between the composed elements. We also discuss the specification of communication flow across component boundaries and describe the additional proof obligations that are required.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Event-B method, and its tools, provide a way to formally model systems; Tasking Event-B is an extension facilitating code generation. We have recently begun to explore how we can configure the code generator, for deployment on different target systems. In this paper, we describe how templates can be used to avoid hard-coding ‘boilerplate’ code, and how to merge this with code generated from the formal model. We have developed a lightweight approach, where tags (i.e. tagged mark-up) can be placed in source templates. The template-processors we introduce may be of use to other plug-in developers wishing to merge a ‘source’ text file with some generated output.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Event-B method is a formal modelling approach; our interest is the final step, of generating code for concurrent programs, from Event-B. Our Tasking Event-B tool integrates Event-B to facilitate code generation. The theory plug-in allows mathematical extensions to be added to an Event-B development. When working at the implementation level we need to consider how to translate the newly added types and operators into code. In this paper, we augment the theory plug-in, by adding a Translation Rules section to the tool. This enables us to define translation rules that map Event-B formulas to code. We illustrate the approach using a small case study, where we add a theory of arrays, and specify translation rules for generating Ada code.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Event-B [1] is a formalism for discrete system modelling. The Rodin platform [2] provides a toolset to carry out specification, refinement and proof in Event-B. The importance of proofs as part of formal modelling cannot be emphasised enough, and as such, it is imperative to provide effective tool support for it. An important aspect of this support is the extensibility of the prover, and more pressingly, how its soundness is preserved while allowing extensibility. Rodin has a limited support for adding rules as this requires (a) a deep understanding of the internal architecture and (b) knowledge of the Java language. Our approach attempts to provide support for user-defined proof rules. We initially focus on supporting rewrite rules to enhance the rewriting capabilities of Rodin. To achieve this objective, we introduce a theory construct distinct from contexts and machines. The theory construct provides a platform for the users to define rewrite rules both conditional and unconditional. As part of rule definition, users decide whether the rule is to be applied automatically or interactively. Each defined rule gives rise to proof obligations that serve to verify its conservativity. In this respect, it is required that validity and well-definedness are preserved by rules. After the conservativity of all rules contained in a theory is established, the theory can then be deployed and available to the proving activity. In order to apply rewrite rules, it is necessary to single out applicable rules to any given sequent. This is achieved through a pattern matching mechanism which is implemented as an extension to Rodin. Our approach has two advantages. Firstly, it offers a uniform mechanism to add proof rule without the need to write Java code. Secondly, it provides a means to verify added rules using proof obligations. Our work is still in progress, and research has to be carried out to (a) cover a larger set of rewrite and inference rules, and (b) provide guidelines to help the theory developer with deciding whether a given rule should be applied automatically.&lt;/p>
