&lt;p>ABZ and other state-based formal methods and tools are successfully applied to the development of safety-critical systems for decades now, in particular in the transport domain, without a single language or tool emerging as the dominant solution for system design. Formal methods are highly recommended by the current safety standards in the railway industry, but railway engineers often lack the knowledge to transform their semi-formal models into formal models, with a precise semantics, to serve as input to formal methods tools. We share the results of performing empirical studies in the railway domain, including usability analyses of formal methods tools involving railway practitioners. We discuss, in particular with respect to railway systems and their modelling, our experiences in applying rigorous state-based methods and tools to a variety of case studies, for which we interacted with a number of companies from the railway domain. We report on lessons learned from these experiences and provide pointers to drive future research towards facilitating further synergies between—on the one hand—researchers and developers of ABZ and other state-based formal methods and tools, and—on the other hand—practitioners from the railway industry.&lt;/p>
