This presentation explores the recent evolution of the Atelier B, from the last keynote in 2016 in Linz to its current, expanded role in system engineering across industries. We will revisit key milestones, such as the modeling of complex systems, the development and programming of the CLEARSY Safety Platform, and its use in educating students and engineers. The session will also showcase how the versatility of Atelier B has been harnessed to model, prove, and implement robust systems—from automated metros to industrial control. Through these advancements, Atelier B continues to shape the landscape of high-integrity software development, merging mathematical rigor with practical, real-world applications.</details><i>Thierry Lecomte (Invited)</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>Keynote</div></div>

Our encoding improves upon previous approaches by eliminating uninterpreted membership predicates and by avoiding the complexity of encoding functions as relations. Through SMT-LIB's support for higher-order constructs, we achieve a more natural representation of B's set theory, while ensuring soundness of the translation. Preliminary experimental results are promising and indicate that our encoding allows solvers to efficiently handle certain proof obligations that previously failed.</details><i>Vincent Tr&#233;lat</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>B</div></div>

In fact, insiders exploit their privileges to perform unauthorized actions. In previous works we proposed to tackle this problem via a backward symbolic search built on a formal B specification of the IS. Unfortunately this approach is not performant because many proof obligations and constraints must be solved interactively. In this paper, we provide a heuristic-based forward search based on the ant colony optimization algorithm (API); that we implemented using ProB. We show how the API algorithm can be used to search for malicious scenarios and we present the results of our experiments in comparison with other approaches.</details><i>Akram Idani and Aur&#233;lien Pepin</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>B</div></div>

The first goal of this project concerns the verification of the proofs built with this systems through their translation to the pivot language LambdaPi. The second goal is the exchange of models and proofs between the considered set-based environments (Rodin, TLAPS, Atelier B). In this paper, we present our preliminary work were we translate Event-B models, proof obligations and their proofs to the TLA+ environment. The translation of models has already been studied in [HL16]. Here, we also generate the proof obligations linked to invariant preservation in TLA+. Lastly, we translate proof interactively built using the Rodin platform to the TLA+ proof language.</details><i>Anne Grieu, Jean-Paul Bodeveix and Mamoun Filali-Amine</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>B</div></div>

The theory comprises a set of postulates defining the class of RAs, an abstract machine model, and the proof that all RAs are captured by this machine model. RAs are sequential-time, parallel algorithms, where every state includes a representation of the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using multiset comprehension terms as values. The model of reflective abstract state machines (rASMs) extends ASMs using extended states that include an updatable representation of the main ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state.</details><i>Klaus-Dieter Schewe and Flavio Ferrarotti</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>ASM</div></div>

Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant financial losses. This paper presents an approach to detecting vulnerable aspects of smart contracts written in Solidity and running on the Ethereum blockchain. Starting from an Abstract State Machine (ASM) model of a smart contract, the absence of certain vulnerabilities is expressed as model invariants. Symbolic execution of the ASM model is then used to reveal faulty execution paths resulting in invariant violations. In this way, vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart contract can be generated. As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running case study, the "Auction" smart contract. Furthermore, we discuss the results of applying the technique to a number of Solidity smart contracts.</details><i>Chiara Braghin, Giuseppe Del Castillo, Elvinia Riccobene and Simone Valentini</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>ASM</div></div>

Nevertheless, ADS are inherently complex, with many of their components, particularly sensors, relying on Artificial Intelligence. In addition to traditional environment data, ADS now processes object recognition outputs. To handle this new type of information, the Bounding Box Specification Language (BBSL) has been formalised to capture the relation between the abstraction of the image with the bounding box and the correct action to be performed. However, this language has a lightweight semantics, leading to multiple interpretations when no tools are available and its semantics remain implicit. In this paper, we propose a framework that fully formalises the language and allows the manipulation of the elements of the language as a first-class citizen in algebraic theory. We introduce three BBSL proof obligations and a mechanism to automatically generate and discharge the proof obligation. We also propose an extension of BBSL by explicitly formalising the semantics and behaviour of external interactions, such as importing information from outside sources. Furthermore, we also propose two instantiation mechanisms, deep-modelling and shallow-modelling, and we use an interpretation of BBSL in an Event-B machine. We demonstrate our approach in an example of BBSL specifications for the braking systems.</details><i>Peter Riviere, Duong Dinh Tran, Takashi Tomita and Toshiaki Aoki</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>B</div></div>

The case study is about a safety controller for autonomous driving on a highway. The description contains two variations of the case study. First, in the simpler setting, we just consider a single- lane highway where each vehicle can accelerate and brake. The goal is to keep a safe distance to the preceding car. Second, we consider a multi-lane highway where each vehicle can also change lanes.<br>The challenge is to model the system and its environment, derive assump- tions, and model a controller that guarantees safety. The challenge is also to present the safety case in such a way that it is convincing to readers not entirely familiar with the formal method employed.<br>The case study is designed so that the formal model can be used as a safety shield within a highway simulation environment. We provide pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents for experimental purposes.

Ensuring the safety of these complex systems is a major open challenge and requires robust mechanisms to enforce correct behavior during runtime. This paper illustrates a run-time safety enforcement framework for the output sanitization of an autonomous driving agent on a highway. The enforcement mechanism is based on a (formally validated and verified) Asmeta model representing the enforcement rules and used at run-time to eventually steer the driving agent to behave safely and avoid collisions. We demonstrate both efficacy and efficiency of the proposed enforcement approach by conducting an experimental evaluation. We connected our safety enforcer with the highway simulation environment and co-executed it with the pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents as provided by the ABZ 2025 case study. We consider the single-lane case with the safety requirement and one scenario of the multi-lane case about preferring the right-most lane.</details><i>Andrea Bombarda, Silvia Bonfanti, Angelo Gargantini, Nico Pellegrinelli and Patrizia Scandurra</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>Case Study</div></div>

Given the unpredictable behaviour of the environment, we analyse some safety guarantees on the behaviour of the agent in terms of its robustness against perturbations. To this end, we make use of the temporal logic RobTL and statistical model checking.

Machine learning is a very different programming approach to algorithm design, and notions of correctness for machine learning systems are still evolving. Increasing levels of autonomy being deployed in robotic systems means weaker concepts of control and predictability, increasing risk of accidents, and challenging conventional safety assurance methods. The role of abstraction/refinement formal methods, such as Event-B, is quite well established for traditional safety-critical systems, but it remains an open question whether and how such methods are applicable to systems with autonomy and learning-based control. <br>Recent ideas on guaranteed safe AI from leading formal methods researchers propose the use of three components to ensure safe AI systems: a safety specification, a world model, and a verifier. At a high level this represents a systems approach to safety analysis which aligns well with common usage of Event-B in conventional system design. Constructing specifications and world (or environment) models for complex systems remains challenging, and abstraction and refinement approaches are aimed at addressing system complexity through incremental modelling and verification. Systematic approaches to analysis of (informal) requirements and of safety hazards also play in important role. We explore how existing work on hierarchical analysis and verification could be extended and relaxed to deal with autonomy and machine learning. The focus is on physical safety rather than broader issues of influences of AI on human behaviours and ethics.<br>The ideas are influenced by collaboration with Asieh Salehi Fathabadi, Colin Snook, Dana Dghaym, Fahad Alotaibi, Haider Al-Shareefy, and Thai Son Hoang.</details><i>Michael Butler (Invited)</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>Keynote</div></div>

However, it is challenging to guarantee that the generated instances are relevant to the user, representing effectively different scenarios. This challenge is exacerbated in quantitative modeling, where one must consider both the qualitative, structural part of a model, and the quantitative data on top of it. This results in a search space of possibly infinite candidate solutions, often infinitesimally similar to one another. Thus, research on instance enumeration in qualitative model finding is not directly applicable to the quantitative context, which requires more sophisticated methods to navigate the solution space effectively. The goal of this paper is to explore and showcase different, generic strategies for navigating quantitative solution spaces, aiming to generate instances that differ considerably from those previously seen, ensuring a larger coverage of the search space. Such generic strategies are implemented in QAlloy – a quantitative extension to Alloy – and are evaluated against several examples ranging, in particular, over the integer and fuzzy domains.</details><i>Pedro Silva, Nuno Macedo and Jos&#233; N.

Due to a lack of trace- ability features, these requirements are difficult to reason about and thus very resistant to change. Validation and verification processes of cyber- physical components based on such specifications require extensive man- ual review and are prone to inefficiencies. This paper describes our work towards a comprehensive methodology for deriving formal specifications for railway signaling and generating veri- fied software for it. Our method focuses on accessibility for domain ex- perts and industrial applicability. To this effect, we integrate established techniques into a unified tool chain comprising (1) fault tree analysis, (2) the goal-oriented requirements engineering method KAOS, and (3) formal modelling with AdaCore SPARK. We aim to facilitate end-to-end traceability of requirements through all artifacts.

The challenge is to ensure that a complex closed system including controller and its environment remain in a safe state while undertaking abnormal state changes in the controller as part of its exception recovery process. Handling exceptional error events is a complex task requiring insight and domain expertise to ensure that potential abnormal conditions are identified and a recovery process is designed to return the system to a safe state. Exception handling relies on a notion of transactions in order to identify how the system can be systematically returned to a consistent state. Formal methods can address this complexity, by supporting the analysis of transactions and exception handling at the abstract design stages utilising mathematical modelling and proofs. Event-B is a state-based formal method for modelling and verifying the consistency of discrete systems, however it lacks explicit support for analysing the handling of exceptions. UML-B is a diagrammatic front-end for Event-B modelling which allows models to be constructed using class diagrams and state-machines. In this paper, we use UML-B state machines to support the modelling of normal behaviour, with a notion of consistency and augment this with a technique for modelling 'transactions' which may either complete to reach a consistent state or encounter exceptional errors that have to return the system to a consistent state despite the non-completion of the transaction. We also discuss an implementation of the modelled exception handling in the `C' programming language as a first stage towards automatic code generation of exception handlers.</details><i>Colin Snook, Asieh Salehi Fathabadi, Thai Son Hoang, Robert Thorburn, Michael Butler, Leonardo Aniello and Vladimiro Sassone</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>B</div></div>

Within this context, we present a model of interacting agents that synchronize with a global state at specific points in time. These agents follow the differential equations of standard kinematics, operating within a physical environment. They can make non-deterministic decisions regarding acceleration and follow strategies to avoid collisions. We instantiate our model according to the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) setting. By defining agent properties such as extensions, cycle times, and acceleration limits, we concentrate on the single-lane model specified in the case study requirements document. A key feature of our instantiation is the consideration of agents operating with independent clocks. We demonstrate that the safety invariants defined by RSS still hold even when agents have independent and mutually unknown clocks. This enhances the model’s realism and makes it well-suited for refinement into implementations using synchronous languages such as Lustre and SCADE, enabling the development of safe and certifiable systems for the automotive industry.</details><i>Paolo Crisafulli, Adrien Durier, Benjamin Puyobro and Burkhart Wolff</i></div><div style=width:10%;display:inline-block>Case Study</div></div>

We demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of our approach through a highway driving case study with different AI agents trained. We construct a formal model of the driving environment, capturing the states and behaviors of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic, and specify the safety requirements within this model.

We employ ProB, a model checker for the B method, to analyse a formal model of the system under test (SUT) and generate test scenarios from the formal B model.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
We develop a behavioural theory of reflective parallel
algorithms (RAs), i.e. synchronous parallel algorithms that
can modify their own behaviour. The theory comprises a set
of postulates defining the class of RAs, an abstract
machine model, and the proof that all RAs are captured by
this machine model. RAs are sequential-time, parallel
algorithms, where every state includes a representation of
the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic
reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using multiset
comprehension terms as values. The model of reflective
abstract state machines (rASMs) extends ASMs using extended
states that include an updatable representation of the main
ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state.

Smart Contracts.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Smart contracts are programs that automate agreements
between parties without the need for intermediaries.
Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency,
immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their
immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes
make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying
vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate
risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant
financial losses.
This paper presents an approach to detecting vulnerable
aspects of smart contracts written in Solidity and running
on the Ethereum blockchain. Starting from an Abstract State
Machine (ASM) model of a smart contract, the absence of
certain vulnerabilities is expressed as model invariants.
Symbolic execution of the ASM model is then used to reveal
faulty execution paths resulting in invariant violations.
In this way, vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart
contract can be generated.
As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running
case study, the "Auction" smart contract. Furthermore, we
discuss the results of applying the technique to a number
of Solidity smart contracts.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
This paper presents a sound encoding of B proof obligations
in SMT-LIB 2.7, leveraging the recent extensions of SMT-LIB
to higher-order logic. Our encoding improves upon previous
approaches by eliminating uninterpreted membership
predicates and by avoiding the complexity of encoding
functions as relations. Through SMT-LIB's support for
higher-order constructs, we achieve a more natural
representation of B's set theory, while ensuring soundness
of the translation. Preliminary experimental results are
promising and indicate that our encoding allows solvers to
efficiently handle certain proof obligations that
previously failed.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Concept-based design is a new emerging formalism that uses
concepts to facilitate the construction of modular and
reusable software.
Concepts are independent and generic units of functionality
that can be
composed to form complex applications. This work presents
Conceptual,
a domain-specific language for defining and composing
concepts. A compiler from this language to Alloy6 is
implemented, establishing a way to formally model and
validate concept specifications of software. The practical
application of Conceptual is examined qualitatively by
leveraging Alloy’s analysis tools to reason about existing
concept specifications in the literature.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Alloy is a modeling language that combines relational
first-order logic and temporal logic while providing
powerful automated analyses via the Alloy Analyzer. Recent
efforts in tool development and teaching of Alloy have
contributed the Alloy4Fun dataset enabling many analyses of
fine-grained model editing histories.
We present a smaller, but complementary dataset of similar
editing granularity. While the Alloy4Fun dataset captures
users filling in predefined predicates, our dataset is more
diverse and users develop all parts of Alloy models
including signatures, fields, facts, and commands.
We illustrate the differences between the datasets, define
a Halstead metric to measure the difficulty of models, and
evaluate model revision histories from both datasets on
various metrics.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
SafeCap is a modern toolkit for modelling, simulation and
formal verification of railway networks, focused on
fully-automated scalable safety verification of solid state
interlocking (SSI) programs – a technology at the heart of
many railway signalling solutions worldwide. In this paper,
we elaborate on the formal foundations of the employed
method by presenting the formal proof semantics of the
modelled systems and the properties we are interested in
verifying. We discuss the composite nature of this
semantics, namely, interrelationships between signalling
programs, signalling plan data, and the safety principles
we need to ensure. The main focus is to formally justify
derivation of a number of proof obligations that a specific
interlocking solution must satisfy. The semantic
definitions, properties, and inference rules are formalised
with the proof assistant Coq.

Verifiable Railway Signalling Specifications.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Specifications for safety-critical railway signaling
systems have
traditionally been expressed in natural language. Due to a
lack of trace-
ability features, these requirements are difficult to
reason about and thus
very resistant to change. Validation and verification
processes of cyber-
physical components based on such specifications require
extensive man-
ual review and are prone to inefficiencies.
This paper describes our work towards a comprehensive
methodology for
deriving formal specifications for railway signaling and
generating veri-
fied software for it. Our method focuses on accessibility
for domain ex-
perts and industrial applicability. To this effect, we
integrate established
techniques into a unified tool chain comprising (1) fault
tree analysis,
(2) the goal-oriented requirements engineering method KAOS,
and (3)
formal modelling with AdaCore SPARK. We aim to facilitate
end-to-end
traceability of requirements through all artifacts.
Currently, we are ap-
plying our methodology to a case study that involves the
specification of
a new ETCS-based moving block signalling system.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
A key feature of model finding techniques allows users to
enumerate and explore alternative solutions. However, it is
challenging to guarantee that the generated instances are
relevant to the user, representing effectively different
scenarios.
This challenge is exacerbated in quantitative modeling,
where one must consider both the qualitative, structural
part of a model, and the quantitative data on top of it.
This results in a search space of possibly infinite
candidate solutions, often infinitesimally similar to one
another.
Thus, research on instance enumeration in qualitative model
finding is not directly applicable to the quantitative
context, which requires more sophisticated methods to
navigate the solution space effectively.
The goal of this paper is to explore and showcase
different, generic strategies for navigating quantitative
solution spaces, aiming to generate instances that differ
considerably from those previously seen, ensuring a larger
coverage of the search space.
Such generic strategies are implemented in QAlloy – a
quantitative extension to Alloy – and are evaluated against
several examples ranging, in particular, over the integer
and fuzzy domains.

Event-B: EB4BBSL framework.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are major engineering and
research topics, and ensuring the safety of such a critical
system becomes crucial. Nevertheless, ADS are inherently
complex, with many of their components, particularly
sensors, relying on Artificial Intelligence. In addition to
traditional environment data, ADS now processes object
recognition outputs. To handle this new type of
information, the Bounding Box Specification Language (BBSL)
has been formalised to capture the relation between the
abstraction of the image with the bounding box and the
correct action to be performed. However, this language has
a lightweight semantics, leading to multiple
interpretations when no tools are available and its
semantics remain implicit. In this paper, we propose a
framework that fully formalises the language and allows the
manipulation of the elements of the language as a
first-class citizen in algebraic theory. We introduce three
BBSL proof obligations and a mechanism to automatically
generate and discharge the proof obligation. We also
propose an extension of BBSL by explicitly formalising the
semantics and behaviour of external interactions, such as
importing information from outside sources.
Furthermore, we also propose two instantiation mechanisms,
deep-modelling and shallow-modelling, and we use an
interpretation of BBSL in an Event-B machine. We
demonstrate our approach in an example of BBSL
specifications for the braking systems.

The work presented here is done in the context of the
French ANR ICSPA (https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE25-0015)
project which aims at studying formal methods based on set
theory (B, Event-B, TLA+). The first goal of this project
concerns the verification of the proofs built with this
systems through their translation to the pivot language
LambdaPi. The second goal is the exchange of models and
proofs between the considered set-based environments
(Rodin, TLAPS, Atelier B).
In this paper, we present our preliminary work were we
translate Event-B models, proof obligations and their
proofs to the TLA+ environment. The translation of models
has already been studied in [HL16].
Here, we also generate the proof obligations linked to
invariant preservation in TLA+. Lastly, we translate proof
interactively built using the Rodin platform to the TLA+

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
In cyber-security, insider threats are particularly
challenging to prevent because they are carried out by
individuals who already have legitimate access to the
information system (IS). In fact, insiders exploit their
privileges to perform unauthorized actions. In previous
works we proposed to tackle this problem via a backward
symbolic search built on a formal B specification of the
IS. Unfortunately this approach is not performant because
many proof obligations and constraints must be solved
interactively. In this paper, we provide a heuristic-based
forward search based on the ant colony optimization
algorithm (API); that we implemented using ProB.
We show how the API algorithm can be used to search for
malicious scenarios and we present the results of our
experiments in comparison with other approaches.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Testing non-deterministic systems is challenging due to un-
predictable behaviours arising from timing, concurrency,
and random in-
puts. This paper explores the application of model-based
testing (MBT)
to tackle these challenges, leveraging formal methods and
tools to en-
sure systematic test coverage. We employ ProB, a model
checker for the
B method, to analyse a formal model of the system under
test (SUT)
and generate test scenarios from the formal B model. As a
proof of con-
cept, we apply MBT to the TLS 1.3 protocol, a widely used
complex
cryptographic standard, and test one of its implementation
using the
BouncyCastle OpenSSL Java API. While the TLS handshake is
primar-
ily deterministic, it includes non-deterministic components
like cipher
selection and random value generation, making it an
excellent candidate
for evaluating MBT’s effectiveness. We present the design
and logic of
our proof of concept, showcasing its flexibility to support
various mod-
els and SUTs. This study demonstrates that combining formal
meth-
ods, non-deterministic analysis, and state-based testing
can effectively
address the challenges of non-deterministic systems,
enabling improved
testing strategies and greater system reliability.

capability hardware using UML-B formal analysis.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
While detection of suspicious or erroneous CPU behaviour
can be achieved by generic mechanisms such as memory safe
processors, recovering safely from the resulting exceptions
is an application specific problem.
The challenge is to ensure that a complex closed system
including controller and its environment remain in a safe
state while undertaking abnormal state changes in the
controller as part of its exception recovery process.
Handling exceptional error events is a complex task
requiring insight and domain expertise to ensure that
potential abnormal conditions are identified and a recovery
process is designed to return the system to a safe state.
Exception handling relies on a notion of
transactions in order to identify how the system can
be systematically returned to a consistent state.
Formal methods can address this complexity, by supporting
the analysis of transactions and exception handling at the
abstract design stages utilising mathematical modelling and
proofs.
Event-B is a state-based formal method for modelling and
verifying the consistency of discrete systems, however it
lacks explicit support for analysing the handling of
exceptions.
UML-B is a diagrammatic front-end for Event-B modelling
which allows models to be constructed using class diagrams
and state-machines.
In this paper, we use UML-B state machines to support the
modelling of normal behaviour, with a notion of consistency
and augment this with a technique for modelling
'transactions' which may either complete to reach a
consistent state or encounter exceptional errors that have
to return the system to a consistent state despite the
non-completion of the transaction. We also discuss an
implementation of the modelled exception handling in the
`C' programming language as a first stage towards automatic
code generation of exception handlers.

<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Logical specifications are widely used to represent
software systems and their desired properties. Under system
degradation or environmental changes, commonly seen in
complex real-world robotic systems, these properties may no
longer hold and so traditional verification methods will
simply fail to construct a proof. However, weaker versions
of these properties do still hold and can be useful for
understanding the system’s behaviour in uncertain
conditions, as well as aiding compositional verification.
We present a counterexample-guided technique for
iteratively weakening properties, apply it to propositional
logic specifications, and discuss planned extensions to
state-based representations.

Mission-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles,
operate in dynamic environments where unexpected events
should be managed while guaranteeing safe behavior.
Ensuring the safety of these complex systems is a major
open challenge and requires robust mechanisms to enforce
correct behavior during runtime. This paper illustrates a
run-time safety enforcement framework for the output
sanitization of an autonomous driving agent on a highway.
The enforcement mechanism is based on a (formally validated
and verified) Asmeta model representing the enforcement
rules and used at run-time to eventually steer the driving
agent to behave safely and avoid collisions. We demonstrate
both efficacy and efficiency of the proposed enforcement
approach by conducting an experimental evaluation. We
connected our safety enforcer with the
highway simulation environment and co-executed it with the
pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents as provided by the ABZ 2025

formal model
of the driving environment, capturing the states and

ego vehicle and surrounding traffic, and specify the safety
requirements
within this model. For each proposed action, we leverage
Maude’s invariant model checker to determine if executing
the action would violate the

This article presents a formal model and formal safety

absence of collision on an infinite time horizon which

Doing so sheds light on inconsistencies between the

The ABZ 2025 conference case study focuses on developing a

interacting agents that synchronize
with a global state at specific points in time.
These agents follow the differential equations of standard
kinematics, operating within a
physical environment. They can make non-deterministic
decisions regarding acceleration and follow
strategies to avoid collisions.
We instantiate our model according to the
Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) setting.
By defining agent properties such as extensions,
cycle times, and acceleration limits, we concentrate on the
single-lane model specified in the case
study requirements document.
A key feature of our instantiation is the consideration
of agents operating with independent clocks. We
demonstrate that the safety invariants defined by RSS
still hold even when agents have independent and mutually
unknown clocks. This enhances the model’s realism and
makes it well-suited for refinement into implementations
using synchronous languages such as Lustre and SCADE,
enabling the development of safe and certifiable systems
