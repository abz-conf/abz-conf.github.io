<summary>Klaus-Dieter Schewe and Flavio Ferrarotti. <b>Behavioural Theory of Reflective Parallel Algorithms.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
We develop a behavioural theory of reflective parallel
algorithms (RAs), i.e. synchronous parallel algorithms that
can modify their own behaviour. The theory comprises a set
of postulates defining the class of RAs, an abstract
machine model, and the proof that all RAs are captured by
this machine model. RAs are sequential-time, parallel
algorithms, where every state includes a representation of
the algorithm in that state, thus enabling linguistic
reflection. Bounded exploration is preserved using multiset
comprehension terms as values. The model of reflective
abstract state machines (rASMs) extends ASMs using extended
states that include an updatable representation of the main
ASM rule to be executed by the machine in that state.

<summary>Chiara Braghin, Giuseppe Del Castillo, Elvinia Riccobene
and Simone Valentini. <b>Using Symbolic Model Execution to Detect Vulnerabilities of
Smart Contracts.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Smart contracts are programs that automate agreements
between parties without the need for intermediaries.
Embedded in a blockchain, they ensure transparency,
immutability, and trustworthiness. While efficient, their
immutable nature and reliance on internet-connected nodes
make them susceptible to attacks. Identifying
vulnerabilities before deployment is critical to mitigate
risks, prevent catastrophic events, and avoid significant
financial losses.
This paper presents an approach to detecting vulnerable
aspects of smart contracts written in Solidity and running
on the Ethereum blockchain. Starting from an Abstract State
Machine (ASM) model of a smart contract, the absence of
certain vulnerabilities is expressed as model invariants.
Symbolic execution of the ASM model is then used to reveal
faulty execution paths resulting in invariant violations.
In this way, vulnerable execution scenarios of the smart
contract can be generated.
As a proof of concept, we show the approach on a running
case study, the "Auction" smart contract. Furthermore, we
discuss the results of applying the technique to a number
of Solidity smart contracts.

<summary>Vincent Trélat. <b>Safely Encoding B Proof Obligations in SMT-LIB.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
This paper presents a sound encoding of B proof obligations
in SMT-LIB 2.7, leveraging the recent extensions of SMT-LIB
to higher-order logic. Our encoding improves upon previous
approaches by eliminating uninterpreted membership
predicates and by avoiding the complexity of encoding
functions as relations. Through SMT-LIB's support for
higher-order constructs, we achieve a more natural
representation of B's set theory, while ensuring soundness
of the translation. Preliminary experimental results are
promising and indicate that our encoding allows solvers to
efficiently handle certain proof obligations that
previously failed.

<summary>Nikolaj Jakobsen. <b>State-Based Modelling with a Concept DSL.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Concept-based design is a new emerging formalism that uses
concepts to facilitate the construction of modular and
reusable software.
Concepts are independent and generic units of functionality
that can be
composed to form complex applications. This work presents
Conceptual,
a domain-specific language for defining and composing
concepts. A compiler from this language to Alloy6 is
implemented, establishing a way to formally model and
validate concept specifications of software. The practical
application of Conceptual is examined qualitatively by
leveraging Alloy’s analysis tools to reason about existing
concept specifications in the literature.

<summary>Soaibuzzaman, Salar Kalantari and Jan Oliver Ringert. <b>On Writing Alloy Models: Metrics and a new Dataset.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Alloy is a modeling language that combines relational
first-order logic and temporal logic while providing
powerful automated analyses via the Alloy Analyzer. Recent
efforts in tool development and teaching of Alloy have
contributed the Alloy4Fun dataset enabling many analyses of
fine-grained model editing histories.
We present a smaller, but complementary dataset of similar
editing granularity. While the Alloy4Fun dataset captures
users filling in predefined predicates, our dataset is more
diverse and users develop all parts of Alloy models
including signatures, fields, facts, and commands.
We illustrate the differences between the datasets, define
a Halstead metric to measure the difficulty of models, and
evaluate model revision histories from both datasets on
various metrics.

<summary>Linas Laibinis, Alexei Iliasov and Alexander Romanovsky. <b>Proof Semantics of Railway Interlocking.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
SafeCap is a modern toolkit for modelling, simulation and
formal verification of railway networks, focused on
fully-automated scalable safety verification of solid state
interlocking (SSI) programs – a technology at the heart of
many railway signalling solutions worldwide. In this paper,
we elaborate on the formal foundations of the employed
method by presenting the formal proof semantics of the
modelled systems and the properties we are interested in
verifying. We discuss the composite nature of this
semantics, namely, interrelationships between signalling
programs, signalling plan data, and the safety principles
we need to ensure. The main focus is to formally justify
derivation of a number of proof obligations that a specific
interlocking solution must satisfy. The semantic
definitions, properties, and inference rules are formalised
with the proof assistant Coq.

<summary>Frederic Reiter, Roman Wetenkamp, Robert Schmid, Richard
Kretzschmar and Lukas Iffländer. <b>Towards an End-to-End Tool Chain for Traceable and
Verifiable Railway Signalling Specifications.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Specifications for safety-critical railway signaling
systems have
traditionally been expressed in natural language. Due to a
lack of trace-
ability features, these requirements are difficult to
reason about and thus
very resistant to change. Validation and verification
processes of cyber-
physical components based on such specifications require
extensive man-
ual review and are prone to inefficiencies.
This paper describes our work towards a comprehensive
methodology for
deriving formal specifications for railway signaling and
generating veri-
fied software for it. Our method focuses on accessibility
for domain ex-
perts and industrial applicability. To this effect, we
integrate established
techniques into a unified tool chain comprising (1) fault
tree analysis,
(2) the goal-oriented requirements engineering method KAOS,
and (3)
formal modelling with AdaCore SPARK. We aim to facilitate
end-to-end
traceability of requirements through all artifacts.
Currently, we are ap-
plying our methodology to a case study that involves the
specification of
a new ETCS-based moving block signalling system.

<summary>Pedro Silva, Nuno Macedo and José N. Oliveira. <b>On Quantitative Solution Iteration in QAlloy.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
A key feature of model finding techniques allows users to
enumerate and explore alternative solutions. However, it is
challenging to guarantee that the generated instances are
relevant to the user, representing effectively different
scenarios.
This challenge is exacerbated in quantitative modeling,
where one must consider both the qualitative, structural
part of a model, and the quantitative data on top of it.
This results in a search space of possibly infinite
candidate solutions, often infinitesimally similar to one
another.
Thus, research on instance enumeration in qualitative model
finding is not directly applicable to the quantitative
context, which requires more sophisticated methods to
navigate the solution space effectively.
The goal of this paper is to explore and showcase
different, generic strategies for navigating quantitative
solution spaces, aiming to generate instances that differ
considerably from those previously seen, ensuring a larger
coverage of the search space.
Such generic strategies are implemented in QAlloy – a
quantitative extension to Alloy – and are evaluated against
several examples ranging, in particular, over the integer
and fuzzy domains.

Event-B: EB4BBSL framework.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are major engineering and
research topics, and ensuring the safety of such a critical
system becomes crucial. Nevertheless, ADS are inherently
complex, with many of their components, particularly
sensors, relying on Artificial Intelligence. In addition to
traditional environment data, ADS now processes object
recognition outputs. To handle this new type of
information, the Bounding Box Specification Language (BBSL)
has been formalised to capture the relation between the
abstraction of the image with the bounding box and the
correct action to be performed. However, this language has
a lightweight semantics, leading to multiple
interpretations when no tools are available and its
semantics remain implicit. In this paper, we propose a
framework that fully formalises the language and allows the
manipulation of the elements of the language as a
first-class citizen in algebraic theory. We introduce three
BBSL proof obligations and a mechanism to automatically
generate and discharge the proof obligation. We also
propose an extension of BBSL by explicitly formalising the
semantics and behaviour of external interactions, such as
importing information from outside sources.
Furthermore, we also propose two instantiation mechanisms,
deep-modelling and shallow-modelling, and we use an
interpretation of BBSL in an Event-B machine. We
demonstrate our approach in an example of BBSL
specifications for the braking systems.

<summary>Anne Grieu, Jean-Paul Bodeveix and Mamoun Filali-Amine. <b>Translating Event-B models and development proofs to TLA.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
The work presented here is done in the context of the
French ANR ICSPA (https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE25-0015)
project which aims at studying formal methods based on set
theory (B, Event-B, TLA+). The first goal of this project
concerns the verification of the proofs built with this
systems through their translation to the pivot language
LambdaPi. The second goal is the exchange of models and
proofs between the considered set-based environments
(Rodin, TLAPS, Atelier B).
In this paper, we present our preliminary work were we
translate Event-B models, proof obligations and their
proofs to the TLA+ environment. The translation of models
has already been studied in [HL16].
Here, we also generate the proof obligations linked to
invariant preservation in TLA+. Lastly, we translate proof
interactively built using the Rodin platform to the TLA+
proof language.

<summary>Akram Idani and Aurélien Pepin. <b>Insider Threat Simulation Through Ant Colonies and ProB.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
In cyber-security, insider threats are particularly
challenging to prevent because they are carried out by
individuals who already have legitimate access to the
information system (IS). In fact, insiders exploit their
privileges to perform unauthorized actions. In previous
works we proposed to tackle this problem via a backward
symbolic search built on a formal B specification of the
IS. Unfortunately this approach is not performant because
many proof obligations and constraints must be solved
interactively. In this paper, we provide a heuristic-based
forward search based on the ant colony optimization
algorithm (API); that we implemented using ProB.
We show how the API algorithm can be used to search for
malicious scenarios and we present the results of our
experiments in comparison with other approaches.

<summary>Alexander Onofrei, Marc Frappier and Émilie Bernard. <b>Model-Based Testing of Non-Deterministic Systems.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Testing non-deterministic systems is challenging due to un-
predictable behaviours arising from timing, concurrency,
and random in-
puts. This paper explores the application of model-based
testing (MBT)
to tackle these challenges, leveraging formal methods and
tools to en-
sure systematic test coverage. We employ ProB, a model
checker for the
B method, to analyse a formal model of the system under
test (SUT)
and generate test scenarios from the formal B model. As a
proof of con-
cept, we apply MBT to the TLS 1.3 protocol, a widely used
complex
cryptographic standard, and test one of its implementation
using the
BouncyCastle OpenSSL Java API. While the TLS handshake is
primar-
ily deterministic, it includes non-deterministic components
like cipher
selection and random value generation, making it an
excellent candidate
for evaluating MBT’s effectiveness. We present the design
and logic of
our proof of concept, showcasing its flexibility to support
various mod-
els and SUTs. This study demonstrates that combining formal
meth-
ods, non-deterministic analysis, and state-based testing
can effectively
address the challenges of non-deterministic systems,
enabling improved
testing strategies and greater system reliability.

capability hardware using UML-B formal analysis.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
While detection of suspicious or erroneous CPU behaviour
can be achieved by generic mechanisms such as memory safe
processors, recovering safely from the resulting exceptions
is an application specific problem.
The challenge is to ensure that a complex closed system
including controller and its environment remain in a safe
state while undertaking abnormal state changes in the
controller as part of its exception recovery process.
Handling exceptional error events is a complex task
requiring insight and domain expertise to ensure that
potential abnormal conditions are identified and a recovery
process is designed to return the system to a safe state.
Exception handling relies on a notion of
transactions in order to identify how the system can
be systematically returned to a consistent state.
Formal methods can address this complexity, by supporting
the analysis of transactions and exception handling at the
abstract design stages utilising mathematical modelling and
proofs.
Event-B is a state-based formal method for modelling and
verifying the consistency of discrete systems, however it
lacks explicit support for analysing the handling of
exceptions.
UML-B is a diagrammatic front-end for Event-B modelling
which allows models to be constructed using class diagrams
and state-machines.
In this paper, we use UML-B state machines to support the
modelling of normal behaviour, with a notion of consistency
and augment this with a technique for modelling
'transactions' which may either complete to reach a
consistent state or encounter exceptional errors that have
to return the system to a consistent state despite the
non-completion of the transaction. We also discuss an
implementation of the modelled exception handling in the
`C' programming language as a first stage towards automatic
code generation of exception handlers.

<summary>Ben M. Andrew. <b>Weakening Goals in Logical Specifications.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Logical specifications are widely used to represent
software systems and their desired properties. Under system
degradation or environmental changes, commonly seen in
complex real-world robotic systems, these properties may no
longer hold and so traditional verification methods will
simply fail to construct a proof. However, weaker versions
of these properties do still hold and can be useful for
understanding the system’s behaviour in uncertain
conditions, as well as aiding compositional verification.
We present a counterexample-guided technique for
iteratively weakening properties, apply it to propositional
logic specifications, and discuss planned extensions to
state-based representations.

<summary>Christophe Chen. <b>Formal modelling and reasoning on Assurance Cases expressed
with GSN in Event-B.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
An Assurance Case (AC) is a structured argumentation for
certification describing how industrial activities support
system requirements. The principle of AC relies on a goal
(requirement) decomposition strategy that recursively
breaks down an abstract goal into more concrete sub-goals
until evidences become directly relevant to substantiate
the goal. The most widely used notation for AC is the Goal
Structuring Notation (GSN), which provides a graphical
representation of argument structures.
Despite the advances in the definition of a methodology for
developing AC using the GSN, establishing the soundness of
ACs relies essentially on experts reviews. Indeed, the lack
of rigorous semantics for the GSN hinders the application
of formal methods to check the consistency of ACs.
The objective of our work is to design a logical (i.e.,
proof-based) framework supporting the definition of
formalised ACs, in order to assist system designers and
certification authorities in building goal structures and
check their consistency with respect to the formalised
semantics and domain knowledge model formalising system
specific concepts. The proposed framework will be grounded
on the Event-B method and associated algebraic theories.
The proposed framework shall define formal semantics for
each GSN component (goal, evidence, assumption, strategy,
etc. ) and formalise the implicit rationale behind goal
decomposition. By leveraging a clear proof mechanism for
the AC expressed in GSN, the impact analysis on argument
modification will be controlled. Moreover, references to
knowledge models and system models will be made explicit in
order to enhance traceability.

highway using Asmeta models@run.time.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
Mission-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles,
operate in dynamic environments where unexpected events
should be managed while guaranteeing safe behavior.
Ensuring the safety of these complex systems is a major
open challenge and requires robust mechanisms to enforce
correct behavior during runtime. This paper illustrates a
run-time safety enforcement framework for the output
sanitization of an autonomous driving agent on a highway.
The enforcement mechanism is based on a (formally validated
and verified) Asmeta model representing the enforcement
rules and used at run-time to eventually steer the driving
agent to behave safely and avoid collisions. We demonstrate
both efficacy and efficiency of the proposed enforcement
approach by conducting an experimental evaluation. We
connected our safety enforcer with the
highway simulation environment and co-executed it with the
pre-trained (unsafe) AI agents as provided by the ABZ 2025
case study. We consider the single-lane case with the
safety requirement and one scenario of the multi-lane case
about preferring the right-most lane.

Through Online Model Checking.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising
approaches
for developing intelligent autonomous driving (AD) agents,
ensuring the
safety of these AI-driven AD systems is a critical
challenge. This paper
proposes an approach to enhancing AD safety through the
development
of a safety shield based on online model checking. The
safety shield acts
as a real-time verification layer, monitoring and
validating the actions
proposed by the AI agent before execution. We demonstrate
the practicality and efficiency of our approach through a
highway driving case
study with different AI agents trained. We construct a
formal model
of the driving environment, capturing the states and
behaviors of the
ego vehicle and surrounding traffic, and specify the safety
requirements
within this model. For each proposed action, we leverage
Maude’s invariant model checker to determine if executing
the action would violate the
safety requirements. Our experimental results demonstrate
the capability
of online model checking to enhance the safety of AI-driven
autonomous
vehicles.

<summary>Enguerrand Prebet, Samuel Teuber and André Platzer. <b>Modelling and Verification of Highway Car Control with
KeYmaera X.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
This article presents a formal model and formal safety
proofs for the ABZ’25 case study in differential dynamic
logic (dL). The case study considers an autonomous car
driving on a highway avoiding collisions with neighbouring
cars. Using KeYmaera X’s dL implementation, we prove
absence of collision on an infinite time horizon which
ensures
that safety is preserved independently of trip length. The
safety guarantees hold for time-varying reaction time and
brake force. Our dL model considers the single lane
scenario with cars ahead or behind. We demonstrate that dL
with its tools is a rigorous foundation for runtime
monitoring, shielding, and neural network verification.
Doing so sheds light on inconsistencies between the
provided specification and simulation environment
highway-env of the ABZ’25 study. We attempt to fix these
inconsistencies and uncover numerous counterexamples which
also indicate issues in the provided reinforcement learning
environment.

Study in Autonomous Driving Safety.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
The ABZ 2025 conference case study focuses on developing a
safety controller for autonomous
highway driving. Within this context, we present a model of
interacting agents that synchronize
with a global state at specific points in time.
These agents follow the differential equations of standard
kinematics, operating within a
physical environment. They can make non-deterministic
decisions regarding acceleration and follow
strategies to avoid collisions.
We instantiate our model according to the
Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) setting.
By defining agent properties such as extensions,
cycle times, and acceleration limits, we concentrate on the
single-lane model specified in the case
study requirements document.
A key feature of our instantiation is the consideration
of agents operating with independent clocks. We
demonstrate that the safety invariants defined by RSS
still hold even when agents have independent and mutually
unknown clocks. This enhances the model’s realism and
makes it well-suited for refinement into implementations
using synchronous languages such as Lustre and SCADE,
enabling the development of safe and certifiable systems
for the automotive industry.

<summary>Sebastian Betancourt and Valentina Castiglioni. <b>On The Road Again (Safely): Modelling and Analysis of
Autonomous Driving with Stark.</b></summary>
<p style="border:2px solid gray;padding:10px">
The Stark tool has been introduced for the the
specification, analysis and verification of cyber-physical
systems operating under uncertainty.
In this paper, we apply it to the modelling and safety
analysis of several instances of a highway environment with
autonomous vehicles: one vehicle will be controlled by a
Stark agent, while the others are modelled as part of a
Stark environment.
Given the unpredictable behaviour of the environment, we
analyse some safety guarantees on the behaviour of the
agent in terms of its robustness against perturbations.
To this end, we make use of the temporal logic RobTL and
statistical model checking.
We then discuss the use of Stark for the validation of the
behaviour of reinforcement learning agents in the highway
environment with the temporal logic DisTL.
