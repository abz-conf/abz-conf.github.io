&lt;p>The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mechanical Lung Ventilator (ABZ 2024)</title><link>/case-study/abz24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/case-study/abz24/</guid><description>&lt;p>This document presents the case study for ABZ 2024 conference. The case study introduces Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV). The MLV is intended to provide ventilation support for patients that require mechanical ventilation in two operative modes: Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). The former is used when patients are not able to start breathing on their own, while the latter support patients by partially taking over the work of breathing.&lt;/p>
