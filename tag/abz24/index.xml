&lt;p>In this paper, we present a formal Event-B model of the Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV), the case study provided by the ABZ’24 conference. This system aims at helping patients maintain good breathing by providing mechanical ventilation. For this purpose, two modes are possible: Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). In the former mode, respiratory cycles are completely defined by the patient that is able to start breathing on its own. In the latter mode, the respiratory cycle is constant and controlled by the ventilator. Let us note that it is possible to move from a given mode to the other depending on the breathing capabilities of the patient under ventilation. In this paper, we illustrate the use of a correct-by-construction approach, the Event-B formal method and its refinement process, for the formal modeling and the verification of such a complex and critical system. The development of the formal models has been achieved under the Rodin platform that provides us with automatic and interactive provers used to verify the correctness of the models. We have also validated the built Event-B models using the ProB animator/model checker.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mechanical Lung Ventilator (ABZ 2024)</title><link>/case-study/abz24/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>/case-study/abz24/</guid><description>&lt;p>This document presents the case study for ABZ 2024 conference. The case study introduces Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV). The MLV is intended to provide ventilation support for patients that require mechanical ventilation in two operative modes: Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). The former is used when patients are not able to start breathing on their own, while the latter support patients by partially taking over the work of breathing.&lt;/p>
