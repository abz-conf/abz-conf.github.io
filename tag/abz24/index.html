<h2><a href=/publication/silvacmo24/>Alloy Goes Fuzzy</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Humans are good at understanding subjective or vague statements which, however, are hard to express in classical logic. Fuzzy logic is an evolution of classical logic that can cope with vague terms by handling degrees of truth and not just the crisp values true and false.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/cornejonpafbr24/>An Analysis of the Impact of Field-Value Instance Navigation in Alloy&amp;apos;s Model Finding</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The use of SAT-based model finding for specification analysis is a crucial characteristic of Alloy, and a main reason of its success as a language for software specification. When a property of a specification is analyzed and deemed satisfiable, the user usually explores instances of the corresponding satisfiability, in order to understand the analysis outcome.

<h2><a href=/publication/bombardabg24/>From Concept to Code: Unveiling a Tool for Translating Abstract State Machines into Java Code</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Formal methods play a crucial role in modeling and quality assurance, but to be deployed on real systems, formal specifications need to be translated into implementation. Manually converting formal models into code poses challenges such as increased costs, limitations in specification reuse, and the potential for introducing errors.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/grieu24/>From Event-B to Lambdapi</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract B, Event-B and TLA+ are modelling notations based on set theory. Dedukti/Lambdapi is a logical framework based on the (\lambda \Pi )-calculus modulo rewriting in which many theories and logics can be expressed.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/hallerstede24/>Loose Observation in Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Refinement of Event-B machines is based on changing internal variables to obtain different data representations. One approach is expressed only in terms of internal variables. In the extreme case it permits refining a machine by another by choosing the gluing invariant “true”.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/armbrusterk24/>Meta-programming Event-B - Advancing Tool Support and Language Extensions</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Transforming models based on their textual representation is a cumbersome task. This is particularly the case for Event-B, where the predominant representation is a set of XML files. As a consequence, tool support is lacking, even for minor refactoring operations.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/ferrarottis24/>Modal Extensions of the Logic of Abstract State Machines</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Based on the logic of non-deterministic Abstract State Machines (ASMs) we define a modal extension (\mathcal{M}\mathcal{L}{\text {ASM}}) by first introducing multi-step predicates and then adding quantification over the number of steps.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/jacquot24/>Multi-model Animation with JeB</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract A challenge posed by model-based formal methods such as Event-B is the validation of the models. This has been recognized and some tools have been created to provide modelers with means to animate models and to explore their behaviour through graphical display.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/sabinus24/>Proof Construction and Checking on Evolving Abstract State Machines</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are widely used in the formalization and verification of the semantics of software or hardware. However, tools for assisting this process for evolving specifications are still lacking.

</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/hoangvwsb24/>Semantics Formalisation - From Event-B Contexts to Theories</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The Event-B modelling language has been used to formalise the semantics of other modelling languages such as Time Mobility (TiMo) or State Chart XML (SCXML). Typically, the syntactical elements of the languages are captured as Event-B contexts while the semantical elements are formalised in Event-B machines.
