&lt;p>The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Safety Controller for Autonomous Driving (ABZ 2025)</title><link>/case-study/abz25/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>/case-study/abz25/</guid><description>&lt;p>This document presents the case study for ABZ 2025 conference.
The case study is about a safety controller for autonomous driving on a highway.
The goal is to keep a safe distance to the preceding car.
The challenge is to model the system and its environment,
and to derive assumptions and model a controller for which the safety can be guaranteed.&lt;/p>
