<h2><a href=/publication/boniol2016sttt/>The landing gear case study: challenges and experiments</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Embedded critical systems need to be validated very thoroughly; it usually results in very long and onerous test phases. Formal techniques, in particular formal specification languages and associated proof tools, could be an advantageous alternative, or at least a good complement and allow a significant reduction of test phases.

<h2><a href=/publication/cunha14/>Bounded Model Checking of Temporal Formulas with Alloy</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Alloy is a formal modeling language based on first-order relational logic, with no native support for specifying reactive systems. We propose an extension of Alloy to allow the specification of temporal formulas using LTL, and show how they can be verified by bounded model checking with the Alloy Analyzer.
</div>

<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/maldonado-lopezcd14/>Detecting Network Policy Conflicts Using Alloy</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In Computer Networks, several studies show that 50 to 80% of infrastructure downtime is caused by misconfiguration [1]. Current approaches are aimed to check the configuration of each device and detect conflicts, inconsistencies and bugs, other approaches focus on the specification of the intended behaviour of a network and the automatic configuration of each one of its elements [2].

<h2><a href=/publication/prinzs14/>Distributed ASM - Pitfalls and Solutions</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract While sequential Abstract State Machines (ASM) capture the essence of sequential computation, it is not clear that this is true of distributed ASM. This paper looks at two kinds of distributed process, one based on a global state and one based on variable access.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/nalbandyangsw14/>Distributed Situation Analysis - A Formal Semantic Framework</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Situation Analysis is critical for dynamic decision-making in responding to real-world situations. The complex and intricate nature of situation analysis processes calls for evolutionary modeling and formal engineering methods that facilitate experimental validation of abstract mathematical descriptions to link the essential design aspects with rapid prototyping in early development phases.

<h2><a href=/publication/dausendr14/>Introducing Aspect-Oriented Specification for Abstract State Machines</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract With the paradigm of aspect orientation, a developer is able to separate the code of so-called cross-cutting concerns from the rest of the program logic. This possibility is useful for formal specifications, too.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/banach14/>Invariant Guided System Decomposition</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We re-examine the problem of decomposing systems in Event-B. We develop a pattern for cross-cutting events and invariants that enables the core dependencies in multi-machine systems to be tracked. We give the essential verification conditions.
