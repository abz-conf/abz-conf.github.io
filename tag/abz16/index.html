<h2><a href=/publication/mashkoor16/>The Hemodialysis Machine Case Study</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This documents presents a description of a case study concerning the control of a hemodialysis (HD) machine. It provides an overview of the requirements and the design of an HD machine including a sketch of the machine’s functionality, related safety conditions, and a top-level system architectural description.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/banach16/>Hemodialysis Machine in Hybrid Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The hemodialysis machine case study is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state).
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/arcainibgr16/>How to Assure Correctness and Safety of Medical Software: The Hemodialysis Machine Case Study</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients. Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/fayollefgl16/>Modelling a Hemodialysis Machine Using Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams and B-like Methods</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This paper presents the specification of the hemodialysis case study, proposed by ABZ'16 conference. The specification was carried out by a coupling of Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (ASTD) and B-like methods.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/gomesb16/>Modelling the Haemodialysis Machine with Circus</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We present a formal model of aspects of the haemodialysis machine case study using the Circus specification notation. We focus on building a model in which each of the software requirements (R-1–36) are represented by a Circus action.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/hoangslb16/>Validating the Requirements and Design of a Hemodialysis Machine Using iUML-B, BMotion Studio, and Co-Simulation</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We present a formal specification of a hemodialysis machine (HD machine) using Event-B. We model the HD machine using iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams and build a corresponding BMotion Studio visualisation.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/lianglg16/>&amp;apos;The Tinker&amp;apos; for Rodin</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract PSGraph [3] is a graphical proof strategy language, which uses the formalisation of labelled hierarchical graphs to provide support for the development and maintenance of large and complex proof tactics.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/leuschelb16/>A Compact Encoding of Sequential ASMs in Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We present a translation of sequential ASMs to Event-B specifications. The translation also addresses the partial update problem, and allows a variable to be updated (consistently) in parallel. On the theoretical side, the translation highlights the intricacies of ASM rule execution in terms of Event-B semantics.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/dghaymtbf16/>A Graphical Tool for Event Refinement Structures in Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The Event Refinement Structures (ERS) approach provides a graphical extension of the Event-B formal method to represent event decomposition and control-flow explicitly. In this paper we present an improved version of the ERS plug-in, which provides a graphical environment for the ERS approach within the Event-B tool, Rodin.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/paulweberz16/>A Model-Based Transformation Approach to Reuse and Retarget CASM Specifications</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a way to specify algorithms, applications and systems in a formal model. Recent ASM languages and tools address either the translation of ASM specifications to a specific target programming language or aim at the execution in a specific environment.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/schellhornepr16/>A Relational Encoding for a Clash-Free Subset of ASMs</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This paper defines a static check for clash-freedom of ASM rules, including sequential and parallel composition, nondeterministic choice, and recursion. The check computes a formula that, if provable, makes a relational encoding of ASM rules possible, which is an important prerequisite for efficient deduction.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/azmymw16/>A Rigorous Correctness Proof for Pastry</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Peer-to-peer protocols for maintaining distributed hash tables, such as Pastry or Chord, have become popular for a class of Internet applications. While such protocols promise certain properties concerning correctness and performance, verification attempts using formal methods invariably discover border cases that violate some of those guarantees.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/lingog16/>A Super Industrial Application of PSGraph</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The ClawZ toolset has been successful in verifying that Ada code is correctly generated from Simulink models in an industrial setting, using the Z notation. D-RisQ is now extending this technique to new domains of the C programming language, which requires changes to their highly complex proof technique.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/stegmaierdrt16/>A Universal Control Construct for Abstract State Machines</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Abstract State Machines can be used to specify arbitrary system behaviour. However, when writing executable specifications one often has to write additional statements which organise how, e.g., in which order, the rules are executed.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/dobrikovl16/>Enabling Analysis for Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In this paper we present a static analysis to determine how events influence each other in Event-B models. The analysis, called an enabling analysis, uses syntactic and constraint-based techniques to compute the effect of executing one event on the guards of another event.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/merzv16/>Encoding TLA + + into Many-Sorted First-Order Logic</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This paper presents an encoding of a non-temporal fragment of the ({\textsc {TLA}} ^{{+}}) language, which includes untyped set theory, functions, arithmetic expressions, and Hilbert’s (\varepsilon ) operator, into many-sorted first-order logic, the input language of state-of-the-art smt solvers.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/boussabbehtmk16/>Formal Proofs of Termination Detection for Local Computations by Refinement-Based Compositions</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In this paper, we propose a formal framework enhancing the termination detection property of distributed algorithms and reusing their specifications as well as their proofs. By relying on refinement and composition, we show that an algorithm specified with local termination detection, can be reused in order to compute the same algorithm with global termination detection.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/clarkbhhl16/>Generating Event-B Specifications from Algorithm Descriptions</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We present a high-level algorithm description language which is translated to Event-B specifications for simulation, model checking and proof. Rather than trying to recover the program structure from a lower-level Event-B specification, we start with a high-level description of the algorithm.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/babinasp16/>Handling Continuous Functions in Hybrid Systems Reconfigurations: A Formal Event-B Development</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract This paper presents a substitution mechanism for systems having a continuous behavior. It shall preserve the safety property stating that the output of both systems remain in a safety envelope.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/kossakm16/>How to Select the Suitable Formal Method for an Industrial Application: A Survey</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract The share of formal methods is still marginal in contemporary systems and software engineering. One of the reasons is the absence of systematic guidelines and evaluation criteria that help software practitioners choose the right formal method for the problem at hand.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/schmidtkl16/>Interactive Model Repair by Synthesis</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract When using B or Event-B for formal specifications, model checking is often used to detect errors such as invariant violations, deadlocks or refinement errors. Errors are presented as counter-example states and traces and should help fixing the underlying bugs.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/chevrouhmq16/>Mechanized Refinement of Communication Models with TLA + +</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract In distributed systems, asynchronous communication is often viewed as a whole whereas there are actually many different interaction protocols whose properties are involved in the compatibility of peer compositions. A hierarchy of asynchronous communication models, based on refinements, is established and proven with the TLA(^+) Proof System.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/baugha16/>Modeling a Discrete Wet-Dry Algorithm for Hurricane Storm Surge in Alloy</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We describe an Alloy model that helps check the correctness of a discrete wet-dry algorithm used in a system for hurricane storm surge prediction. Derived from simplified physics and encoded with empirical rules, the algorithm operates on a finite element mesh to allow the propagation of overland flows.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/borger16/>Modeling Distributed Algorithms by Abstract State Machines Compared to Petri Nets</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We show how to model distributed algorithms by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Comparing these models with Petri nets (PNs) reveals a certain number of idiosyncrasies of PNs which complicate both model design and analysis.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/edmundssw16/>On Component-Based Reuse for Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Efficient reuse is a goal of many software engineering strategies and is useful in the safety-critical domain where formal development is required. Event-B can be used to develop safety-critical systems, but could be improved by a component-based reuse strategy.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/kringsl16/>Proof Assisted Symbolic Model Checking for B and Event-B</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We have implemented various symbolic model checking algorithms, like BMC, k-Induction and IC3 for B and Event-B. The high-level nature of B and Event-B accounts for complicated constraints arising in these symbolic analysis techniques.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/azaiezdllm16/>Proving Determinacy of the PharOS Real-Time Operating System</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Executions in the PharOS real-time system are deterministic in the sense that the sequence of local states for every process is independent of the order in which processes are scheduled.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/iliasovsar16/>Rodin Platform Why3 Plug-In</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract We briefly present the motivation, architecture and usage experience as well as proof statistics for a new Rodin Platform proof back-end based on the Why3 umbrella prover. Why3 offers a simple and versatile notation as a common interface to a large number of automated provers including all the leading SMT-LIB and TPTP compliant tools.
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2><a href=/publication/grovilkcg16/>Semi-Automated Design Space Exploration for Formal Modelling</a></h2>
<div class=article-style>
Abstract Refinement based formal methods allow the modelling of systems through incremental steps via abstraction. Discovering the right levels of abstraction, formulating correct and meaningful invariants, and analysing faulty models are some of the challenges faced when using this technique.
