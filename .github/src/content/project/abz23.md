This document presents the case study for ABZ 2023 conference. The case study introduces a safety critical interactive system called
AMAN (Arrival MANager) which is a partly-autonomous scheduler of landing sequences of aircraft in airports. This interactive systems interleaves Air Traffic Controllers activities with automation in AMAN. While some AMAN systems are currently deployed in airports, we consider here only a subset of functions which represent a challenge in modelling and verification.
