This document presents the case study for ABZ 2025 conference.
The case study is about a safety controller for autonomous driving on a highway.
The goal is to keep a safe distance to the preceding car.
The challenge is to model the system and its environment,
and to derive assumptions and model a controller for which the safety can be guaranteed.

For a more detailed description of the case study, and the document reporting the requirements see [here](../../site/2025/casestudy).
