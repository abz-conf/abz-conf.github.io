## Abstract

This case study continues the successful series of case studies for formal specification and verification of the ABZ conference series, which started with the landing gear system[1] and expanded with the hemodialysis medical device[4] and the European Train Control System (ETCS)[2] in the following years. This document describes two systems from the automotive domain: an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). This specification is based on the SPES XT running example[3]. Besides their general architectures, the requirements of the software based controllers are described. Both systems are only loosely coupled, which makes it possible to handle them independently
