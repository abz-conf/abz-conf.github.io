## Abstract

Visualization is important to present formal models to domain experts and to spot issues which are hard to formalise or have not been formalised yet. VisB is a visualization plugin for the ProB animator and model checker. VisB enables the user to create simple visualizations for formal models. An important design criterion was to re-use scalable vector graphics (SVG) generated by off-the-shelf graphic editors using a lightweight and easy-to-use annotation mechanism. The visualizations can be used to formal models in B, Event-B, Z, TLA+ and Alloy.
