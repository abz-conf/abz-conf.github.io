## Abstract

The present paper describes an Event-B model of the Arrival MANager system (called AMAN), the case study provided by the ABZâ€™23 conference. The goal of this safety critical interactive system is to schedule the arrival times of aircraft at airports. This system includes two parts: an autonomous part which predicts the arrival time of an aircraft from external sources (flight plan information, radar and weather information, etc.) and an interface part that permits to the Air Traffic Controller (ATCo) to submit requests to AMAN like changes regarding the arrival times of aircraft. To formally model and verify this critical system, we use a correct-by-construction approach with the Event-B formal method and its refinement process. We mainly consider functional features of the case study; all proof obligations have been discharged using the provers of the Rodin platform under which we carried out our development. To help users understand how AMAN works and its main functionalities, a visualisation of the Event-B models was achieved using the VisB component of ProB. Our models have been validated using ProB by applying scenarios related to different functional aspects of the system.
