## Abstract

Crucible is a suite of tools supporting the use of Alloy as a functional specification language for high-integrity software systems. It incorporates a test generator, animator and range of supporting tools. Test generation is achieved by producing test conditions from the input Alloy model, and then using the Alloy Analyzer to produce solutions. The solutions can optionally be converted into executable tests targeting a range of implementation languages. The animator allows scenarios to be defined by users and run to help stakeholders validate the Alloy model. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Crucible tools.
