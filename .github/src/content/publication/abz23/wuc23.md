## Abstract

Modelling hybrid systems using Event-B is challenging and users typically are unsure about whether their Event-B models are over/under-specified. In this short paper, we present a work-in-progress specification language called Cyclone to tackle this challenge. We demonstrate how one can use Cyclone to check an Event-B hybrid model using a car controller example. Our demonstration shows that Cyclone has a great potential to be used to verify Event-B hybrid models.
