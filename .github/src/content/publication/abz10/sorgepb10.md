## Abstract

Feature-oriented modelling is a well-known approach for Software Product Line (SPL) development. It is a widely used method when developing groups of related software. With an SPL approach, the development of a software product is quicker, less expensive and of higher quality than a one-off development since much effort is re-used. However, this approach is not common in formal methods development, which is generally high cost and time consuming, yet crucial in the development of critical systems. With the increase of more complex critical systems, it becomes more important to apply formal methods to the development cycle, and we propose a method that allows the application of SPL development techniques to formal methods. This results in faster and cheaper development of formal systems.
