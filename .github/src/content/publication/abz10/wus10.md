## Abstract

Many authors have drawn parallels between the relational model of data and the formal description technique Z, yet none of these contributions have managed to be both close to the relational model in terms of providing a practical means of database design and fully formal in terms of providing an appropriate metamodel. We compare these various formalisms, and suggest how the use of the formal template approach of Am√°lio et al might help to overcome some of the issues faced. We demonstrate the application of this work via a short case study, and suggest further enhancements to the template language.
