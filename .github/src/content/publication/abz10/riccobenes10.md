## Abstract

The SystemC UML profile is a modeling language designed to lift features and abstractions of the SystemC/C++ class library to the UML level with the aim of improving the current industrial System-on-Chip design methodology. Its graphical syntax and static semantics were defined following the “profile” extension mechanism of the UML metamodel, while its behavioral semantics was given in natural language. This paper provides a precise and executable semantics of the SystemC Process State Machines that are an extension of the UML state machines and are part of the SystemC UML profile to model the reactive behavior of the SystemC processes. To this purpose, we used the meta-hooking approach of the ASM-based semantic framework, which allows the definition of the dynamic semantics of metamodel-based languages and of UML profiles.
