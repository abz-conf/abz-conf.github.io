## Abstract

How should a software system be verified? Much research is currently focused on attempts to show that code modules meet their specifications. This is important, but bugs in code are not the weakest link in the chain. The larger problems are identifying and articulating critical properties, and ensuring that the components of a system - not only software modules, but also hardware peripherals, physical environments, and human operators - together establish them. Another common assumption is that verification must take system design and implementation as given. Iâ€™ll explain the rationale for, and elements of, a new approach to verification, in which design is driven by verification goals, and verification arguments are structured in a way that exposes the relationship between critical properties and the components that ensure them.
