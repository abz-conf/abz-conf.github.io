## Abstract

We extend the Alloy language with the standard imperative constructs; we show the mix of declarative and imperative constructs to be useful in modeling dynamic systems. We present a translation from our extended language to the existing first-order logic of the Alloy Analyzer, allowing for efficient analysis of models.
