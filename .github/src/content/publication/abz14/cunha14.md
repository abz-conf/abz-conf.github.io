## Abstract

Alloy is a formal modeling language based on first-order relational logic, with no native support for specifying reactive systems. We propose an extension of Alloy to allow the specification of temporal formulas using LTL, and show how they can be verified by bounded model checking with the Alloy Analyzer.
