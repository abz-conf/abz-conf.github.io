## Abstract

In this paper, we present recent developments in the Alt-Ergo SMT-solver to efficiently discharge proof obligations (POs) generated by Atelier B. This includes a new plugin architecture to facilitate experiments with different SAT engines, new heuristics to handle quantified formulas, and important modifications in its internal data structures to boost performances of core decision procedures. Experiments realized on more than 10,000 POs generated from industrial B projects show significant improvements.
