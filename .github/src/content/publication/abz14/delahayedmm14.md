## Abstract

We introduce BWare, an industrial research project that aims to provide a mechanized framework to support the automated verification of proof obligations coming from the development of industrial applications using the B method and requiring high integrity. The adopted methodology consists in building a generic verification platform relying on different automated theorem provers, such as first order provers and SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers. Beyond the multi-tool aspect of our methodology, the originality of this project also resides in the requirement for the verification tools to produce proof objects, which are to be checked independently. In this paper, we present some preliminary results of BWare, as well as some current major lines of work.
