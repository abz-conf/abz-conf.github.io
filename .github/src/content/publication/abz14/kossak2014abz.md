## Abstract

We present an ASM model for the case study given as a challenge for the ABZ'14 conference, which specifies the digital part of a landing gear system for aircraft. We strove to make the formal model well understandable for humans. We note inconsistencies, ambiguities and gaps in the case study and summarise our experiences during modelling and the proof of safety properties.
