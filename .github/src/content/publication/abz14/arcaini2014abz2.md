## Abstract

Formal specifications are widely used in the development of safety critical systems, as the Sensor Voting Module of the Landing Gear System. However, the conformance relationship between the formal specification and the concrete implementation must be checked. In this paper, we show a technique to formally link a Java class with its Abstract State Machine formal specification, and two approaches for checking their conformance: an offline model-based testing approach and an online runtime monitoring approach.
