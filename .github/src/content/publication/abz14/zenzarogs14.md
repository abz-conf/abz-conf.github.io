## Abstract

We describe WebASM, a web-based environment that embeds the CoreASM execution engine in a web page. WebASM provides several advantages to specification writers: (1) complex behaviour expressed via ASM can be made visible by using the full power of the web-based presentation layer; (2) ASM specifications can be edited and run interactively via any web browser; (3) the full CoreASM environment is made available via zero-install deployment, thus eliminating a major barrier to the adoption of the language. In this paper, we briefly outline the technicalities of the approach, present an example, and survey possible applications of WebASM.
