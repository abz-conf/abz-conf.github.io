## Abstract

Situation Analysis is critical for dynamic decision-making in responding to real-world situations. The complex and intricate nature of situation analysis processes calls for evolutionary modeling and formal engineering methods that facilitate experimental validation of abstract mathematical descriptions to link the essential design aspects with rapid prototyping in early development phases. For the transition from abstract concepts and requirements to precise specifications to high level design of situation analysis systems, we derive here a generic ASM ground model as a framework for defining the precise meaning of fundamental situation analysis concepts applicable to different application domain models.
