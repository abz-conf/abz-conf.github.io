## Abstract

This work in progress presents a prototype multi-simulation environment for the Rodin platform that enables import, co-modelling and co-simulation of dynamic models and formal Event-B specifications, which can help in the design of mixed discrete-event/continuous-time systems. The proposed solution is based on the Functional Mock-up Interface standard and ProB animator for Event-B. The involved technologies and co-simulation semantics are explained, followed by a demonstration of preliminary results, obtained from a landing gear case study.
