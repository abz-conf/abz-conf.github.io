## Abstract

The proof assistant Isabelle/HOL is made available inside a flexible system framework allowing for logically safe extensions, which comprise both theories as well as implementations for code-generation, documentation, and specific support for a variety of formal methods. Following the techniques in [9] and the theoretical groundwork in [4], we show the major milestones for the implementation of a B-Tool and the resulting refinement method inside the Isabelle/HOL platform. The prototype HOL-B provides IDE support, documentation support, a theory for the Z-Mathematical Toolkit underlying the B-Method, and a generated denotational semantics for a B MACHINE specification implemented as a specification construct in Isabelle/HOL. Extended by more automated proof machinery geared to refinements, HOL-B can serve as a more portable, flexible and extensible tool for Event-B that may profit from the large Isabelle/HOL libraries providing Algebra and Analysis theories.
