## Abstract

This paper introduces the ABZ 2024 Case Study: Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV), inspired by the Mechanical Ventilator Milano developed during COVID-19. The case study reports the specification of the Mechanical Lung Ventilator used to ventilate patients who are not able to breathe on their own or need ventilation support. Expected contributions to the case study include, among others, modeling, validation and verification, management of temporal behavior, modeling of the graphical user interface or automatically generating executable source code.
