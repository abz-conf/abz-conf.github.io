## Abstract

This paper introduces a novel approach to formal modelling and verification of ownership, addressing safety concerns in property transfer processes. The Event-B formal method, graphically represented using iUML-B notation, is used to establish a robust framework for modeling and verifying ownership systems. The verified Event-B model refines and enhances user requirements at the design stage before system implementation. The research focuses on property ownership within the legal framework of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, specifically property sales. The research uncovers that, despite conscientious efforts to scrutinise user requirements, the formal model development exposes limitations and inadequacies in the initial specifications. The verification process introduces essential requirements to mitigate potential fraudulent activities, enhancing the security and dependability of ownership claims.
