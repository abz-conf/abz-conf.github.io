## Abstract

The Event-B modelling language has been used to formalise the semantics of other modelling languages such as Time Mobility (TiMo) or State Chart XML (SCXML). Typically, the syntactical elements of the languages are captured as Event-B contexts while the semantical elements are formalised in Event-B machines. An alternative for capturing a modelling languageâ€™s semantics is to use the Theory plug-in to build datatypes capturing the syntactical elements of the language and operators to represent the various semantical aspects of the language. This paper draws on our experience on the statemanchines (part of SCXML) to compare the two approaches in terms of modelling efforts.
