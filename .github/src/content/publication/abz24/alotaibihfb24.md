## Abstract

In the design of autonomous systems, seamless integration with human operators is crucial, particularly when humans are considered as a fail-safe for intervening in hazardous situations. This study presents an Event-B intervention timing pattern designed to include human driversâ€™ responses when they act as fallback mechanisms in Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) systems. The proposed pattern outlines specific timings for driver interventions following alerts from SDVs, offering a clear set of expectations and conditions for human drivers during these critical takeover instances. The usability of this pattern is demonstrated through a case study, highlighting its importance for situations that require interventions. Ultimately, it sheds light on the operational aspects of SDVs, ensuring a safe and orderly transition from automated to manual control.
