## Abstract

In this paper, we use NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) and the Event-B formal method to model and verify the requirements for the ABZ 2024 case study which is a mechanical lung ventilator. We use the FRET requirements to guide the development of a formal design model in Event-B. We provide details about the artefacts produced and reflect on our experience of using these tools in this case study. We focus on the functional and controller requirements for this system, as given in the case study documentation. This paper provides a first step towards using Event-B as part of a FRET-guided verification workflow in a large case study.
