## Abstract

We propose an approach to achieve interoperability in a family of domain specific language based on the use of their ASM semantics and of the category theory. The approach is based on the construction of a unifying language of the family, by using categorical colimits. Since the unifying language is obtained by construction, translators to this one are obtained easily. These are the premises for using ASM tools for symbolically executing systems made of components specified in domain specific languages of a same family.
