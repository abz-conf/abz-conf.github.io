## Abstract

Current day systems are ever more detailed and complex leading to the necessity of developing models that abstract unimportant implementation details while emphasizing their structure. Until recently it was only possible to perform temporal model checking in an Event-B model by converting the model to B-METHOD and then using ProB [1]. More recently, a prototype ProB plug in [2] for the RODIN tool has been developed. Nevertheles, encoding Event-B to Alloy allows building on top of the Alloy model finding engine therefore benefiting from all of its optimizations. An extended version of this work is in [3].
