## Abstract

SystemC (built upon C++) [2] is an IEEE industry-standard language for system-level models, specifically targeted at architectural, algorithmic, transaction-level modelling. Recently, a further improvement has been achieved by trying to combine SystemC with lightweight software modelling languages like UML to describe system specifications. In accordance with the design principles of the OMGâ€™s Model-driven architecture (MDA), we defined a model-driven design methodology for embedded systems [3] based on the UML 2, a SystemC UML profile (for the HW side), and a multi-thread C UML profile (for the SW side), which allows UML modelling of the system at higher levels of abstraction (from a functional level down to RTL level).
