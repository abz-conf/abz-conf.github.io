## Abstract

This paper is about generating tests from test purposes, in addition to structural tests. We present a method that re-uses a behavioural model and an abstract test concretization layer developed for structural testing, and relies on additional test purposes. We propose, in the B framework, a process of test generation that uses the symbolic animation mechanisms of LTG (Leirios Test Generator) based on constraint solving, and guided by the test purposes. We build for that a B animable model that is the synchronized product of a behavioural B abstract model and a test purpose described as a labelled transition system. We prove the correctness of this method, and illustrate it by means of the IAS case study. IAS is a smart-card application dedicated to the operations of Identification, Authentication and electronic Signature.
