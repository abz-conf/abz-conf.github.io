## Abstract

Refining a B specification into an implementation can be a complex and time consuming process. This process can usually be separated in two distinct parts: the specification part, where the refinement is used to introduce new properties and specification details, and the implementation, where refinement is used to convert a detailed B specification into a B0 implementation. The first part requires human interaction, since it corresponds to writing the specification. However, the implementation part is more mechanical, and usually corresponds to apply known refinement schemes.
