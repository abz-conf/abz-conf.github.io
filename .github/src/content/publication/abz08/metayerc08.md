## Abstract

Some RATP units are responsible for evolution and maintenance of an automated interlocking specification document. In order to improve their paper and pencil process, RATP asked Systerel if Event-B could be useful to them. An eight month study was launched whose main goal was to help RATP improving their confidence in their interlocking specification, by applying an Event-B approach on rewriting their requirement document.
