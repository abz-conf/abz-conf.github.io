## Abstract

In this paper we examine the difference between model checking high-level and low-level models. In particular, we compare the ProB model checker for the B-method and the Spin model checker for Promela. While Spin has a dramatically more efficient model checking engine, we show that in practice the performance can be disappointing compared to model checking high-level specifications with ProB. We investigate the reasons for this behaviour, examining expressivity, granularity and Spinâ€™s search algorithms. We also show that certain types of information (such as symmetry) can be more easily inferred and exploited in high-level models, leading to a considerable reduction in model checking time.
