## Abstract

In this paper we discuss our progress towards building a model-checker for Z. The approach we take in our Z2SAL project involves implementing a translation from Z into the SAL input language, upon which the SAL toolset can be applied. The toolset includes a number of model-checkers together with a simulator. In this paper we discuss our progress towards implementing as complete as a translation as possible, the limitations we have reached and the optimizations we have made. We illustrate with a small example.
