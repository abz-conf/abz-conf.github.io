## Abstract

In 2004, the UK Computing Research Committee initiated a number of Grand Challenges aimed at stimulating long term research in key areas of computing science. One of the challenges (GC6) focuses on Dependable Systems Evolution. GC6 has two central principles: theory should be embodied in tools, and tools should be tested against real systems. The goal is to produce a Verifying Compiler (a suite of integrated tools) and a repository of verified software.
