## Abstract

The notion of Abstract State Machines(ASMs) handles a practical new approach for modeling and analysing various kinds of discrete dynamic systems. In the context of the verification problem of ASM models, formal verification techniques based on variants of restricted first-order temporal logic have been used to verify correctness of restricted forms of ASM specifications. In this spirit, the current work shows how the state-based logic of TLA + can be employed to formally reason about dynamic systems formalised in terms of ASMs.
