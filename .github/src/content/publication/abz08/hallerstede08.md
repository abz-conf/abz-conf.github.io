## Abstract

Event-B is a formal modelling method which is claimed to be suitable for diverse modelling domains, such as reactive systems and sequential program development. This claim hinges on the fact that any particular model has an appropriate semantics. In Event-B this semantics is provided implicitly by proof obligations associated with a model. There is no fixed semantics though. In this article we argue that this approach is beneficial to modelling because we can use similar proof obligations across a variety of modelling domains. By way of two examples we show how similar proof obligations are linked to different semantics. A small set of proof obligations is thus suitable for a whole range of modelling problems in diverse modelling domains.
