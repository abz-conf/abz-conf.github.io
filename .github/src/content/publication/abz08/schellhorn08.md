## Abstract

Effective and efficient support for the incremental development of verified implementations from abstract requirements has always been of central importance for the successful application of formal methods in practice. Effective means first, that a modelling language is available that allows an adequate problem specification. Second, a refinement theory must be available that preserves the relevant properties of the abstract specification. Efficient means, that the refinement theory reduces the problem to the essential proof obligations necessary, and that the theorem prover provides powerful deduction support. The talk discusses the topic from the experience we have gained from formalizing various refinement theories [1], [2] with the interactive theorem prover KIV [3], as well as from the correctness proofs for various case studies involving refinement.
