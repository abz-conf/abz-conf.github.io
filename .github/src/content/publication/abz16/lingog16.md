## Abstract

The ClawZ toolset has been successful in verifying that Ada code is correctly generated from Simulink models in an industrial setting, using the Z notation. D-RisQ is now extending this technique to new domains of the C programming language, which requires changes to their highly complex proof technique. In this paper, we present initial results in the technology transfer of the graphical PSGraph language to support this extension, and show feasibility of PSGraph for industrial use with strong maintainability requirements.
