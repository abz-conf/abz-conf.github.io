## Abstract

We present a formal specification of a hemodialysis machine (HD machine) using Event-B. We model the HD machine using iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams and build a corresponding BMotion Studio visualisation. We focus on validation using (i) diagrams to aid the modelling of the sequential properties of the requirements, and (ii) ProB-based animation and visualisation tools to explore the systemâ€™s behaviour. Some of the safety properties involve dynamic behaviour which is difficult to verify in Event-B. For these properties we use co-simulation tools to validate against a continuous model of the physical behaviour.
