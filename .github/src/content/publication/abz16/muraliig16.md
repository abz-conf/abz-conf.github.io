## Abstract

Use cases are a popular but informal technique used to define and analyse system behaviour. We introduce UC-B a plug-in for the Rodin platform (Event-B tool) that supports the authoring and management of use case specifications with both informal and formal components. The formal component is based on Event-Bâ€™s mathematical language. Once the behaviour of the use case is specified, UC-B automatically generates a corresponding Event-B model. The resulting model is then amenable to the Rodin verification tools that enable system level properties to be verified. By underpinning informal use case modelling with Event-B we are able to provide greater precision and formal assurance during the early stages of design.
