## Abstract

In distributed systems, asynchronous communication is often viewed as a whole whereas there are actually many different interaction protocols whose properties are involved in the compatibility of peer compositions. A hierarchy of asynchronous communication models, based on refinements, is established and proven with the TLA\(^+\) Proof System. The work serves as a first step in the study of the substituability of the communication models when it comes to compatibility checking.
