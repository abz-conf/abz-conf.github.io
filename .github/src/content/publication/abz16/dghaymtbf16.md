## Abstract

The Event Refinement Structures (ERS) approach provides a graphical extension of the Event-B formal method to represent event decomposition and control-flow explicitly. In this paper we present an improved version of the ERS plug-in, which provides a graphical environment for the ERS approach within the Event-B tool, Rodin. The improved ERS plug-in is based on the available frameworks that are developed to support Event-B with an EMF framework, language extensions and generic diagram extensions.
