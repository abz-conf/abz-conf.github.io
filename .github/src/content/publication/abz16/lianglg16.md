## Abstract

PSGraph [3] is a graphical proof strategy language, which uses the formalisation of labelled hierarchical graphs to provide support for the development and maintenance of large and complex proof tactics. PSGraph has been implemented as the Tinker system, which previously supported the Isabelle and ProofPower theorem provers [4]. In this paper we present a Rodin version of Tinker, which allows Rodin users to encode, analyse and debug their proof strategies in Tinker.
