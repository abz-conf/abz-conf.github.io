## Abstract

We introduce Sterling, a web-based visualization tool that provides interactive views of relational models and allows users to create custom visualizations using modern JavaScript libraries like D3 and Cytoscape. We outline its design goals and architecture, and describe custom visualizations developed with Sterling that enable verification studies of scientific software used in production. While development is driven primarily by the Alloy community, other relational modeling languages are accommodated by Sterlingâ€™s data agnostic architecture.
