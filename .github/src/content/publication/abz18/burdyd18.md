## Abstract

This paper presents an evolution of an industrial proof support framework that integrates state-of-the-art technologies without compromising the existing tool qualification status. Third-party provers produce proof rules that may be applied by the legacy system and verified using a certified approach. This approach has been implemented in Atelier B, a formal-methods based IDE for the development of software components and for the modeling of systems.
