## Abstract

The design of hybrid systems controllers requires one to handle both discrete and continuous functionalities in a single development framework. In this paper, we propose the design and verification of such controllers using a correct-by-construction approach. We use proof-based formal methods to model and verify the required safety properties of the given controllers. Both Event-B with Rodin, and hybrid programs and dynamic differential logic with KeYmaera are experimented on a common case study related to the modelling of a car controller. Finally, we discuss the lessons learnt from these experiments and draw the first steps towards a generic method for modelling hybrid systems in Event-B.
