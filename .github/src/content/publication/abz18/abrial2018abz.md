## Abstract

Usually, case studies dealing with train systems concentrate on the safety of trains circulating on tracks equipped with points and crossings and protected by means of traffic lights and speed limit sign postings as in [1, 2, 3]. Train drivers are supposed to follow such indications. The goal of formal approaches used in such case studies is to prove that trains may circulate safely on such tracks provided drivers act correctly. This is done by constructing models of such complex systems and by using formal proof techniques.
