## Abstract

According to the vision of Design for Reliability, software reliability has to be considered in all the activities within the software development life cycle. In particular, writing formal specifications, like other activities in software development, is error-prone, especially for large-scale systems. This paper presents a reliability prediction method for Abstract State Machines specifications. The method considers the internal structure of an ASM by computing its reliability based on the reliabilities calculated inductively along the call tree of the ASM rules and the structure of the rule bodies.
