## Abstract

Event-B is a formal method that allows flexible modelling and refinement of systems. However, it is hard to convince developers to adopt it because they are not used to mathematical models and it doesn’t provide any practical refinement method. On the other hand, UML has become the de facto standard for software modelling since it provides an easy graphical notation and nowadays it is supported by many practical process such as ICONIX. In this paper we propose a method for Event-B refinement based on a diffused UML-driven development process. So far, we have defined the steps of the method and the translation of most of the artifacts presented in ICONIX to Event-B.
