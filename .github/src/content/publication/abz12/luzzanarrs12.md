## Abstract

This paper proposes the use of the Abstract State Machine method for a rigorous foundation in modeling and validating Vision-Based Robot Control applications. We show how to tailor control tasks definitions and associated synchronization/communication patterns in rigorous and abstract terms by using control state ASMs and an extension of the classical flowchart notation to allow the definition/instantiation of recurring design solutions and to improve model traceability.
