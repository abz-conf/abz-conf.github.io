## Abstract

In this paper we propose an approach to verify PLC programs, a common platform to control systems in the industry. Programs written in the languages of the IEC 61131-3 standard are automatically translated to B machines and are then amenable to formal analysis of safety constraints and general structural properties of the application. This approach thus integrates formal methods into existing industrial processes.
