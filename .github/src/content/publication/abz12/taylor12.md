## Abstract

Many high-integrity software development processes prevent any assumptions about the system hardware, but this makes it impossible to use these techniques on software that must interact with the hardware, such as device drivers. This work takes the opposite approach: if the analyst accepts that the analysis will only be valid for a particular target system then the specification of the system can be used to infer the behaviour of the software that interacts with it. An analysis process is developed that operates on disassembled executable files and formal specifications of the target platform to produce CSP-OZ formal models of the softwareâ€™s behaviour. This analysis process is implemented in a prototype called Spurinna. This is demonstrated in conjunction with the verification tools Z2SAL and the SAL suite to demonstrate the verification of properties of an example program.
