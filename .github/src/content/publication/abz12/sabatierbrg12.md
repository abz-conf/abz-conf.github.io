## Abstract

The New York City Transit Authority has included formal proofs at system level as part of the safety assessment for its New York subway Line 7 modernization project, based on the CBTC from Thales Toronto. ClearSy carries out these proofs. In this paper, we describe the expected results and benefits of such proofs. We also discuss the methodology, in particular the importance of obtaining a natural language precursor for proofs. This step is paramount to find the simplest reasons why the design ensures the wanted properties.
