## Abstract

We present an idea how to simplify Gurevichâ€™s parallel ASM thesis. The key idea is to modify only the bounded exploration postulate from the sequential ASM thesis by allowing also non-ground comprehension terms. The idea arises from comparison with work on ASM foundations of database transformations.
