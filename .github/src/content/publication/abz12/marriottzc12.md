## Abstract

Previous work described how to translate Simulink control law diagrams into CircusÂ specifications to facilitate verification by refinement. This is not a trivial task; several tools have been developed to automate parts of the translation. This paper introduces a new tool chain that extends and integrates existing technology to cover the entire translation and cater for a larger set of diagrams. Our contributions include the integration of data types, generic definitions, and extension of the technique to model action and enabled subsystems. The tool chain has been validated using an industrial case study.
