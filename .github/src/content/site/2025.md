### Düsseldorf (Germany) - Jun 10, 2025 — Jun 13, 2025

<br>

The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.

The 11th instalment of the ABZ conference will be held at
the [**Haus der Universität**](https://www.hdu.hhu.de/en), located in the centre of Düsseldorf
with easy access to the airport and central rail station.
