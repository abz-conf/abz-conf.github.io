### Tokyo (Japan) - 2026

<br>

The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.

The 12th instalment of the ABZ conference will be held in Tokyo, Japan, co-located with <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026">FM 2026 (The 27th International Symposium on Formal Methods)</a>.


<!--the [**Tribe hotel**](https://tribehotels.com/en/germany/dusseldorf/), located in the centre of Düsseldorf
with easy access to the airport and central rail station.
