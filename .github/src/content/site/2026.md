### Tokyo (Japan) - May 18 — May 20 2026

<br>

<span style="color:maroon">Call for papers (Research Track and Case Study Track) is open! The deadline for abstract registration is Feb 9, 2026.</span>


The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.

The 12th instalment of the ABZ conference will be held in Tokyo, Japan, co-located with <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026">FM 2026 (The 27th International Symposium on Formal Methods)</a>.
