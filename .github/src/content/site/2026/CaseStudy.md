## Case Study: Planetary Rover - Call for Papers

As successfully practiced in previous editions of ABZ, the 12th edition of ABZ will include again special sessions dedicated to a shared case study.

The objective of this session is to enrich the set of case studies ([https://abz-conf.org/case-studies/](https://abz-conf.org/case-studies/)) developed with Rigorous State Based Methods with a practical and real-life case study.
Its goal is also cross-fertilisation, enabling practitioners of the individual formal methods to
better understand each other.

The case study is about an <b>autonomous planetary rover</b>.
