## Doctoral Symposium - Call for Papers

The ABZ PhD Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to state based formal methods for software and system development.

This forum is a good opportunity for PhD students to

- bring together PhD students and established and known researchers of the state based formal methods community,
- provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach,
- enable PhD students to interact with other PhD students and to stimulate exchange of ideas suggestions and experiences among participants,
- provide PhD students an opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical atmosphere.

We seek PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete, or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted for the main conference in order to participate to the ABZ 2024 Doctoral Symposium.

### ABZ 2024 invites:

* **Contribution to doctoral symposium**: This is an excellent opportunity for PhD students to present their ongoing work and receive valuable feedback from the ABZ community. A paper of no more than *4 pages (excluding references)* in [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) is expected and will be reviewed.

Preferably, submissions should include

- Title of the paper and the author name
- Problem statement, motivations, and progress
- Current development and related work
- Proposed solutions, approach and methodology, and their significance
- Current results and assessement
- Future work
