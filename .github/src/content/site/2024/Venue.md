#### By Car

We do not recommend reaching the venue by car, as the entire Città Alta area is a Limited Traffic Zone (only selected vehicles, e.g., residents, can access that area). The Limited Traffic Zone is active between 10:00 to 12:00 and between 14:00 to 19:00.

You can find the map of all areas involved in the Limited Traffic Zone, as well as the map of all the cameras surveilling the entries, [here](https://territorio.comune.bergamo.it/gfmaplet/?map=ZoneTL&highlightFeatures=ZTL|4|ID_ZONA=1%20) (unfortunately, only available in Italian).

If you wish to park in Città Alta, there is a [new parking](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ce2DAMZfRvy3WQzD7) very close to the conference venue, and you can access the Limited Traffic Zone if you park there. It costs 3,50 €/h.
