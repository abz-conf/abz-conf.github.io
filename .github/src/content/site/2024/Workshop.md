## Workshops

ABZ 2024 will host the two following workshops.

### Rodin workshop

Event-B is a formal method for system-level modeling and analysis. The Rodin Platform is an Eclipse-based toolset for Event-B that provides effective support for modeling and automated proof. The platform is open source and is further extendable with plug-ins. A range of plug-ins have already been developed.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together existing and potential users and developers of the Rodin toolset and to foster a broader community of Rodin users and developers.

For Rodin users, the workshop will provide an opportunity to share tool experiences and gain an understanding of ongoing tool developments. For plug-in developers, the workshop will provide an opportunity to showcase their tools and to achieve better coordination of tool development efforts. 

Participants may attend or present both in person or remotely. 
If you are willing to participate remotely, please contact the organizers.

#### Format and date

The workshop will host presentations, with ample time for discussions.

The Rodin workshop will be held on June 25, 2024.

### IVOIRE workshop

Historically, formal methods and supported environments have focused more on only one-half of the quality-assurance process: verification (are we building the software right?). 
The other half, validation (are we building the right software?), has been given much less attention, i.e., we have fewer automated/push-button tools available for validation, unlike verification. 
The IVOIRE workshop focuses on developing an enhanced formal paradigm based on an extension of the refinement framework that includes a comprehensive validation process and toolchain to perform validation obligations. 

The main goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for formal methods practitioners, researchers, and academics to discuss various issues associated with validation for formal methods, including but not limited to:
- Validation obligations or other systematic approaches to validation
- Relation between refinement and validation and the interplay between verification and validation
- Environments and tools to manage the validation process
- Evaluations, benchmarking, case studies, etc.
