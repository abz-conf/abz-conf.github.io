## Case Study - Call for Papers

As successfully practiced since ABZ 2014, the 10th edition of ABZ will again include special sessions dedicated to an industrial case study. 

### Guidelines

- **Case study papers**: Full papers reporting on the experiments conducted with any of the state based techniques in the scope of ABZ 2024 case study. A paper of no more than *16 pages (excluding references)* in [LNCS format](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) is expected and will be reviewed.

Accepted papers will appear in the Springer LNCS proceedings. 

### Submission Process

Authors should consult [Springer's authors' guidelines](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/svproc/guidelines/Springer_Guidelines_for_Authors_of_Proceedings.pdf) and use their proceedings templates, either for [LaTeX](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/llncs2e.zip) or for [Word](ftp://ftp.springernature.com/cs-proceeding/llncs/word/splnproc1703.zip[), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their [ORCIDs](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid) in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

Authors interested in contributing to ABZ 2024 in Open Access or Open Choice should refer to the corresponding [Springer webpage](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings).
