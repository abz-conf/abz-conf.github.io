## Workshops

ABZ 2025 will host the following workshops (to be completed).

### Rodin workshop

Event-B is a formal method for system-level modeling and analysis. The Rodin Platform is an Eclipse-based toolset for Event-B that provides effective support for modeling and automated proof. The platform is open source and is further extendable with plug-ins. A range of plug-ins have already been developed.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together existing and potential users and developers of the Rodin toolset and to foster a broader community of Rodin users and developers.

For Rodin users, the workshop will provide an opportunity to share tool experiences and gain an understanding of ongoing tool developments. For plug-in developers, the workshop will provide an opportunity to showcase their tools and to achieve better coordination of tool development efforts. 

Participants may attend or present both in person or remotely. 
If you are willing to participate remotely, please contact the organizers.
