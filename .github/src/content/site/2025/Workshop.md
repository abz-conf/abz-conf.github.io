## Workshops

ABZ 2025 will host the following workshops (to be completed).

### Rodin workshop

Event-B is a formal method for system-level modeling and analysis. The Rodin Platform is an Eclipse-based toolset for Event-B that provides effective support for modeling and automated proof. The platform is open source and is further extendable with plug-ins. A range of plug-ins have already been developed.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together existing and potential users and developers of the Rodin toolset and to foster a broader community of Rodin users and developers.

For Rodin users, the workshop will provide an opportunity to share tool experiences and gain an understanding of ongoing tool developments. For plug-in developers, the workshop will provide an opportunity to showcase their tools and to achieve better coordination of tool development efforts. 

Participants may attend or present both in person or remotely. 
If you are willing to participate remotely, please contact the organizers.

#### Format and date

The workshop will host presentations, with ample time for discussions.

The Rodin workshop will be held on June 10, 2025.

#### Submission

If you are interested in giving a presentation at the Rodin workshop or have a plug-in to demonstrate, send a short abstract (1 or 2 pages PDF) to rodin@ecs.soton.ac.uk by 10th May.
We will endeavour to accommodate all submissions that are clearly relevant to Rodin and Event-B.
The proceedings of the workshop will be available as a technical report at the University of Southampton.

Additional details can be found at [https://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Rodin_Workshop_2025](https://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Rodin_Workshop_2025)

#### Exclusive Opportunity: Special Issue Publication

This year, we are excited to announce that selected high-quality submissions will be invited to contribute to a Special Issue: Formal Methods in Computer Science: Theory and Applications
This issue will be published in the renowned Mathematics journal (ISSN 2227-7390, IF 2.3, JCR Q1). Authors of accepted submissions will have the exclusive opportunity to submit a manuscript with a special discount (up to 100%) on publication fees, subject to peer review.

### Formal Methods for Autonomous Flying Systems

This workshop will consist of two parts:
- a presentation and tutorial on using B and ProB in the classroom to enable students to write formal B models which can control drones
- additional contributions by participants

Unmanned aerial vehicle, including drones and electric flying taxis, will be essential in the future, supporting areas like logistics, transportation, infrastructure monitoring, disaster response, defense, and surveillance.
Accidents involving unmanned aerial vehicle could lead to serious threats to human lives, the environment,
or cause significant financial damages. Therefore, ensuring the safety of unmanned aerial vehicle is crucial.
This workshop focuses on using formal methods as a key approach to improve and ensure the safety of unmanned aerial vehicle.
Our goal is to provide a platform for discussing challenges, issues and solutions in the domain of unmanned aerial vehicle.
Relevant topics are:

- Modeling, Validation, and Verification of aerial vehicles
- Modeling, Validation, and Verification of multi-agent systems
- Validation and verification of AI-driven systems
- Runtime monitoring and runtime verification
- Application of formal methods to real-world aerial vehicles
- Simulation and Co-simulation
- Case studies with aerial vehicles

If you are interested in giving a presentation at the workshop, send a short abstract (1 or 2 pages of PDF) to fabian.vu@hhu.de.
