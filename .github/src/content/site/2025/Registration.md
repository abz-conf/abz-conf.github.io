## Student Policy

We are not sure if we can offer special student rates yet.
We will strive to make the overall rate as affordable as possible.

## Visa Information

If you need a visa for traveling to Germany, we can provide you with an invitation letter needed for obtaining the visa. You have to explicitly indicate it in the email when you send the payment receipt.
