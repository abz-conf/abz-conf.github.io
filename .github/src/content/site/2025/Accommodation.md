## Accommodation

We have secured a contigent of rooms at a guaranteed rate of 95 Euro per night with the [Tribe hotel](https://tribehotels.com/en/germany/dusseldorf/) near the central station of Düsseldorf.
It is a three minute walk from the central station and thus ideal for everybody arriving by train
or plane (as are direct S-Bahn train from the airport to the central station taking 14 minutes).

To book the accommodation for ABZ'2025 you can use this email address: hc1t5-re@mytribehotel.com
You can also book rooms at the hotel via other platforms. If you wish you can also stay in another hotel.

The conference and all workshops will be held in the hotel.
