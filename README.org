** How to add a new section for new editions of ABZ

The ABZ website can be found under the folder =.github/src/content/site=

For each edition you should have:

- A folder (see =.github/src/content/site/2024/=) containing all pages, written using Markdown, for that ABZ edition
- A markdown file, with the year as the name (see =.github/src/content/site/2024.md=), representing the homepage of that ABZ edition
