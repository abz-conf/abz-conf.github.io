* =abz-conf.github.io=: ABZ Conference and Community Website

** How to add a new section for new ABZ editions of

The ABZ conference website can be found under the folder =.github/src/content/site=

For each edition you should have:

- A folder, with the year as the name (see =.github/src/content/site/2024/=), containing all pages, written using Markdown, for that ABZ edition
- A markdown file, with the year as the name (see =.github/src/content/site/2024.md=), representing the homepage of that ABZ edition
- A markdown file with the year as the name, shown in the ABZ organization website and saved under =.github/src/content/event/=. In this way, the new ABZ edition will be available under the list of events on the ABZ organization website

Traditionally, the ABZ conference website has an image of the city skyline in the upper right corner of the page, in the menu bar.
If you want to continue including the skyline, it should be placed under the folder =.github/src/static/img= as an svg file. In the pages in which the skyline has to be shown, in the header of the markdown page, you should fill the corresponding lines as in the following example: 

#+BEGIN_SRC
skyline:
    image: "bergamo-skyline.svg"
    url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamo"
#+END_SRC

The =image= field is the name of the skyline image, while the =url= field is the link to the information page of the city.

*** Navigation bar menus

If new menus or pages are needed for the ABZ edition of the year =X=, besides creating the corresponding markdown file under the =X= folder, it is also needed to add the corresponding entry in the file =.github/src/config/_default/menus.toml=
This file contains several entries, one for each website page. Entries having =[[main]]= as the first label are those of the pages of the ABZ organization website. Instead, those marked with =[[conference]]= are available on the ABZ edition website.
For each entry, you can specify:

- =parent= the name of the parent entry. It is used when you are specifying a sub-menu entry, thus it can be optional
- =name= the name shown on the webpage
- =url= the name of the markdown file (without extension)
- =weight= defines the order in which menus are shown

*** Images

Images can be used as well in ABZ webpages. If they are needed, they have to be placed under the folder =.github/src/static/img/=.

*** Automatic generation of the program

Writing and maintaining the program of the conference can be a complex process, as it involves several people and several updates due to participants' constraints. 
To simplify this process, I have developed a very simple Python script that can automatically generate the program starting from a YAML file. 
The script is available in the folder =.github/src/data/ProgramGenerator= which contains:

- =program.yaml= the file containing the program of the conference
- =pageGenerator.py= the script that generates the program and creates the file =page.html= in the same folder. The content of this file can be copied and pasted into the =Program.md= file of the corresponding ABZ edition folder

The =program.yaml= file contains the =days= array, in which every =day= element has the following structure:

- =day= is the name or date of the day to be shown on the program webpage
- =workshopOrConference= can be either "Workshop" or "Conference". It is used to distinguish between the two types of events and to show them with different labels in the program
- =room= is the name of the room hosting the events for that day
- =program= is the array of all the papers/events/entries of the specific day. Each entry contains the following fields:
  - =paper= the name of the paper/event/entry. It is the only mandatory field
  - =background= the color to be used as the background
  - =start= the starting time
  - =end= the end time
  - =author= the list of the authors of the paper
  - =topic= the topic of the paper
  - =abstract= the abstract of the paper
