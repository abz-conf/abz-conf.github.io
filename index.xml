The following &lt;strong>&lt;em>three ingredients&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> of the method support to &lt;strong>&lt;em>develop executable code from specifications by stepwise refinement&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> where at each step both mathematical verification of desired properties and experimental model validation by testing can be applied and fully documented to permit design for change.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- @ppaulweber: update "the concept ..." -->
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;h2 id="the-concept-of-asm">the concept of ASM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>defined in [1], a semantically well-founded and arguably most general form of conceptually executable pseudo-code.
The definition provides a uniform language to express any intended computational system at any development stage in terms of operations at an appropriate level of abstraction operating directly over objects (read: the system STATE, including input and output) determined by that level of abstraction.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;h2 id="the-concept-of-asm-ground-model">the concept of ASM ground model&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>defined in [2], i.e. a rigorous requirements model that is expressed in application domain terms.
A ground model ASM turns natural language requirements into a mathematical form that supports the inspection of the model by both domain and software experts, whereby the intended correctness and completeness of the requirements can be effectively checked and documented.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;h2 id="the-concept-of-asm-refinement">the concept of ASM refinement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>defined in [3]. It permits to develop a system in well-documented controllable modular steps, linking ASMs at different levels of abstraction, say an abstract and a more detailed model, in a way the software engineer can justify as correct implementation step.
The executability of ASMs supports using testing methods to validate the models whereas their mathematical nature allows one to adopt mathematical verification techniques where appropriate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The entire set of refinement steps transforms a ground model into well-documented executable code.
The model analysis at different levels of abstraction helps to avoid and to identify and correct fundamental design errors, which are difficult to detect and expensive to correct in code.
The intermediate models also support model reuse and design (programming) for change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that the development process is by no means linear, as is illustrated by the following diagram:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="overview.svg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For an introductory &lt;strong>text book&lt;/strong> with lecture slides see the &lt;em>Modeling Book&lt;/em> [4] or the &lt;em>Asm Book&lt;/em> [5].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For &lt;strong>case studies&lt;/strong> which illustrate typical applications of the method see the JBook [6] and provided
&lt;a href="/case-studies">case studies&lt;/a> on this page.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the &lt;strong>early history&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; of the development of the method and early applications in various fields of computer science &amp;ndash; up to 2003 see [7] (available from &lt;a href="https://www.jucs.org/jucs_8_1/the_origins_and_the/Boerger_E.pdf">https://www.jucs.org/jucs_8_1/the_origins_and_the/Boerger_E.pdf&lt;/a>) and &lt;a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/gasm/subjects/montage.html">http://web.eecs.umich.edu/gasm/subjects/montage.html&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>epistemological motivation&lt;/strong> for the definition of ASMs was to improve Turing&amp;rsquo;s thesis, which has been proved in [2] from three natural axioms for sequential algorithms.
For the further development of such axiomatic and corresponding ASM-characterizations of algorithmic concepts (e.g. recursive algorithms, reflective algorithms, synchronous parallel algorithms, concurrent algorithms, communicating algorithms, etc.) see [9].
In practice, this so-called behavioral theory of ASMs supports the arguably most general form of ASMs as system specification.&lt;/p>

This created Alloy model can then be analyzed by the Alloy Analyzer, a solver that finds concrete structures that satisfy the constraints defined in the Alloy model.
The analysis can be used to generate sample structures or to check properties of these structures by trying to generate counterexamples. Alloy is based on the Z specification language and Tarski&amp;rsquo;s relational calculus.&lt;/p>

It is based on the Z notation but slightly more low-level. In B a system consists of an abstract machine in which the modeler specifies the goal of the system. Via several refinement steps, this abstract goal is enhanced by more details on a less abstract level by adding details about data structures and algorithms that define how the goal is achieved.
All steps are proven correct until a deterministic version (the implementation) is reached.&lt;/p>

Similar to B a system is modeled by different abstraction levels that are connected by a rigorous refinement proven correct. Whereas the B-method is intended to the development of correct-by-construction software, the purpose of Event-B is to model full systems (including hardware and operation environment). These two languages share almost the same mathematical language.&lt;/p>

The language aims for defining the set of all correct system behaviors. It is organized in modules that contain a definition of states and (conditional) state transitions in form of steps. A &amp;ldquo;next-state-relations&amp;rdquo; defines how variables can change in any step. Similar to Z, B, and Event-B TLA+ is based on the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, but extended with built-in temporal logic operators.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The functional behavior can be either defined abstract by pre- and postconditions or explicitly by specific state-based operations. The precise mathematical semantics of these definitions allows for a wide range of analyses, e.g. static analysis, testing or proof of properties of the sytem.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This case study continues the successful series of case studies for formal specification and verification of the ABZ conference series, which started with the landing gear system[1] and expanded with the hemodialysis medical device[4] and the European Train Control System (ETCS)[2] in the following years. This document describes two systems from the automotive domain: an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). This specification is based on the SPES XT running example[3]. Besides their general architectures, the requirements of the software based controllers are described. Both systems are only loosely coupled, which makes it possible to handle them independently&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an Event-B model of the ABZ2018 case study on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard. The case study focusses on the management of fixed virtual sub-sections (VSS). We model the hybrid level 3 of the standard, which assumes that trains may be either equipped with an on-board train integrity monitoring system (TIMS) and that they report their position and integrity, ERTMS trains not fitted with TIMS that report only their front position or non-ERTMS trains that do not report any information about their position. We take into account most of the main features of the case study. Our model is decomposed into four refinements. All proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers, except those related to the computation of the VSS state machine, which was found to be ambiguous (nondeterministic). Our model has been validated using ProB. The main safety property, which is that ERTMS trains do not collide, is proved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We demonstrate diagrammatic Event-B formal modelling of a hybrid, &amp;lsquo;fixed virtual block&amp;rsquo; approach to train movement control for the emerging European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) level 3. We perform a refinement-based formal development and verification of the no-collision safety requirement. The development reveals limitations in the specification and identifies assumptions on the environment. We reflect on our team-based approach to finding useful modelling abstractions and demonstrate a systematic modelling method using the UMLlike state and class diagrams of iUML-B. We suggest enhancements to the existing iUML-B method that would have benefitted this development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a specification of the hybrid ERTMS/ETCS level 3 standard in the framework of the case study proposed for the 6th edition of the ABZ conference. The specification is based on the method and tools, developed in the ANR FORMOSE project, for the modeling and formal verification of critical and complex system requirements. The requirements are specified with SysML/KAOS goal diagrams and are automatically translated into B System specifications, in order to obtain the architecture of the formal specification. Domain properties are specified by ontologies with the SysML/KAOS domain modeling language, based on OWL and PLIB. Their automatic translation completes the structural part of the formal specification. The only part of the specification, which must be manually completed, is the body of events. The construction is incremental, based on the refinement mechanisms existing within the involved methods. The formal specification of the case study is composed of seven refinement levels and all the proofs have been discharged with the Rodin prover.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Spin model checker has been successfully applied to the modelling, validation, and verification of different safety-critical systems. In this paper, we model and validate the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 Case Study using Spin; in particular, we show the assumptions we made to keep the state space limited, and present the problems and ambiguities that arose during the modelling. Although Spin offers several advantages in terms of validation and verification facilities, its modelling language Promela is limited if compared to higher level notations of other formal methods. Therefore, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the tool, and how it could be improved in terms of modelling facilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Usually, case studies dealing with train systems concentrate on the safety of trains circulating on tracks equipped with points and crossings and protected by means of traffic lights and speed limit sign postings as in [1, 2, 3]. Train drivers are supposed to follow such indications. The goal of formal approaches used in such case studies is to prove that trains may circulate safely on such tracks provided drivers act correctly. This is done by constructing models of such complex systems and by using formal proof techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this article, we present a concrete realisation of the ETCS Hybrid Level 3 concept, whose practical viability was evaluated in a field demonstration in 2017. Hybrid Level 3 (HL3) introduces Virtual SubSections (VSS) as sub-divisions of classical track sections with Trackside Train Detection (TTD). Our approach introduces an add-on for the Radio Block Centre (RBC) of Thales, called Virtual Block Function (VBF), which computes the occupation states of the VSSs according to the HL3 concept using the train position reports, train integrity information, and the TTD occupation states. From the perspective of the RBC, the VBF behaves as an Interlocking (IXL) that transmits all signal aspects for virtual signals introduced for each VSS to the RBC. We report on the development of the VBF, implemented as a formal B model executed at runtime using ProB and successfully used in a field demonstration to control real trains.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper reports on the development of a formal model for the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 concept in Electrum, a lightweight formal specification language that extends Alloy with mutable relations and temporal logic operators. We show how Electrum and its Analyzer can be used to perform scenario exploration to validate this model, namely to check that all the example operational scenarios described in the reference document are admissible, and to reason about expected safety properties, which can be easily specified and model checked for arbitrary track configurations. The Analyzer depicts scenarios (and counter-examples) in a graphical notation that is logic-agnostic, making them understandable for stakeholders without expertise in formal specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Embedded critical systems need to be validated very thoroughly; it usually results in very long and onerous test phases.
Formal techniques, in particular formal specification languages and associated proof tools, could be an advantageous alternative, or at least a good complement and allow a significant reduction of test phases. However, for these techniques to be used in practice, one issue to consider is their efficiency and scalability on complex industrial systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hemodialysis machine case study is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state). A broadly component based strategy is adopted, using the multi-machine and coordination facilities of Hybrid Event-B. Since, like most medical procedures, hemodialysis is under overall human control, it is largely a sequential process, with some branching to deal with exceptional circumstances. This makes for a relatively uncomplicated modelling framework, provided a model of the operator is included in order to capture the handling of exceptions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients. Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper takes advantage of the Hemodialysis machine case study to present a formal development process supporting most of the engineering activities required by the standards, and provides rigorous approaches for system validation and verification. The process is based on the Abstract State Machine formal method and its model refinement principle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents the specification of the hemodialysis case study, proposed by ABZ'16 conference. The specification was carried out by a coupling of Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (ASTD) and B-like methods. astd are a graphical notation, based on automata and process algebra operators. They provide an easy-to-read specification of the dynamic behaviour of the system. The data model is specified using the Event-B language. The system is incrementally designed using extended refinement of both methods.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a formal model of aspects of the haemodialysis machine case study using the Circus specification notation. We focus on building a model in which each of the software requirements (R-1–36) are represented by a Circus action. All of these act in concert with actions that model the collection of sensor data and the progress through the various therapy phases and activities. We then present how we model check the system using FDR.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a formal specification of a hemodialysis machine (HD machine) using Event-B. We model the HD machine using iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams and build a corresponding BMotion Studio visualisation. We focus on validation using (i) diagrams to aid the modelling of the sequential properties of the requirements, and (ii) ProB-based animation and visualisation tools to explore the system’s behaviour. Some of the safety properties involve dynamic behaviour which is difficult to verify in Event-B. For these properties we use co-simulation tools to validate against a continuous model of the physical behaviour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This article describes the Event-B modeling of a landing gear system of an aircraft whose complete description can be found in Boniol and Wiels (The Landing Gear System Case Study, ABZ Case Study, Communications in Computer Information Science, vol 433, Springer, Berlin, 2014). This real-life case study has been proposed by the ABZ’2014 track that took place in Toulouse, the European capital of the aeronautic industry. Our modeling is based on the Parnas and Madey’s 4-Variable Model that permits to consider the different parts of a system. These parts are incrementally introduced using the Event-B refinement technique. The entire development has been carried out with the Rodin toolset. To ensure the correctness of the different components, we use several verification techniques (animation, model checking and proof) depending on the complexity and the kind of the properties to verify. Basically, prior to the proof phase that can be tedious and complex, we use the animator ANIMB and the model checker PROB that permit to discover some trivial inconsistencies. Once no error is reported, we start the proof phase by using the Atelier B and SMT provers which we installed on Rodin. We conclude the article by drawing up some key findings of and lessons learned from this experience.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this article, we present our formalization of the ABZ landing gear case study in Event-B. The development was carried out using the Rodin platform and mainly used superposition refinement to structure the specification. To validate the model, we complemented proof with animation and model checking. For the latter, we used the ProB animator and model checker. Graphical representation of the model turned out to be crucial in the development and validation of the model; this was achieved using the visualization features provided by ProB and BMotion Studio. In addition, we discuss the positive and negative aspects of the Event-B language and tools which we encountered while working on the ABZ case study.&lt;/p>

abstract=&amp;quot;In this article, we present our formalization of the ABZ landing gear case study in Event-B. The development was carried out using the Rodin platform and mainly used superposition refinement to structure the specification. To validate the model, we complemented proof with animation and model checking. For the latter, we used the ProB animator and model checker. Graphical representation of the model turned out to be crucial in the development and validation of the model; this was achieved using the visualization features provided by ProB and BMotion Studio. In addition, we discuss the positive and negative aspects of the Event-B language and tools which we encountered while working on the ABZ case study.&amp;quot;,

&lt;p>This paper describes the modeling, done using the Event-B notation, of the aircraft landing gear case study that is proposed in a special track of the ABZ’2014 Conference. In the course of our development, we discovered some problems in our initial modeling approach. This has led us to propose a second approach and then a third one. Each approach is more efficient than the previous one in terms of proof obligations (roughly speaking: 2000, 1000, 500). All this will be described in this paper. We also try to go beyond this specific case study and give some thoughts about large industrial modeling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite the high level of automation, the practicability of formal verification through model-checking of large models is hindered by the combinatorial explosion problem. In this paper we apply a novel context-aware verification technique to the Landing Gear System Case Study (LGS) [2]. The idea is to express and verify requirements relative to certain environmental situations. The system environment is decomposed into several independent scenarios (contexts), which are successively composed with the system during reachability analysis. These contexts are specified using a language called CDL (Context Description Language), based on activity and message sequence diagrams. The properties to be verified are specified with observer automata and attached to specific regions in the context. This approach enables an automated context-guided decomposition of the verification into smaller problems, hence effectively reducing the state-space explosion problem. In the case of the LGS this technique enabled the fully-automated decomposition of the verification into 885 smaller model-checking problems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present an ASM model for the case study given as a challenge for the ABZ'14 conference, which specifies the digital part of a landing gear system for aircraft. We strove to make the formal model well understandable for humans. We note inconsistencies, ambiguities and gaps in the case study and summarise our experiences during modelling and the proof of safety properties.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe our experience with modeling the landing gear system of an aircraft using the formal specification language Fiacre. Our model takes into account the behavior and timing properties of both the physical parts and the control software of this system. We use this formal model to check safety and real-time properties on the system but also to find a safe bound on the maximal time needed for all gears to be down and locked (assuming the absence of failures). Our approach ultimately relies on the model-checking tool Tina, that provides state-space generation and model-checking algorithms for an extension of Time Petri Nets with data and priorities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper describes the Event-B modeling of the landing gear system of an aircraft whose the complete description can be found in [3]. This real-life case study has been proposed by the ABZ’2014 track that takes place in Toulouse, the European capital of the aeronautic industry. Our modeling is based on the Parnas and Madey’s 4-Variable Model that permits to consider the different parts of a system. These parts are incremently introduced using the Event-B refinement technique. The entire development has been carried out under the Rodin toolset. To validate and prove the different components, we use the Atelier B, SMT and ML provers which are plugged to Rodin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a stepwise formal development of the landing system of an aircraft. The formal models include the complex behaviour, temporal behaviour and sequence of operations of the landing gear system. The models are formalized in Event-B modeling language, and then the ProB model checker is used to verify the deadlock freedom and to validate the behaviour requirements by animating the formalized models.

abstract=&amp;quot;This paper presents a stepwise formal development of the landing system of an aircraft. The formal models include the complex behaviour, temporal behaviour and sequence of operations of the landing gear system. The models are formalized in Event-B modeling language, and then the ProB model checker is used to verify the deadlock freedom and to validate the behaviour requirements by animating the formalized models. This case study is considered as a benchmark for techniques and tools dedicated to the verification of behavioural properties of the complex critical systems.&amp;quot;,

&lt;p>The paper presents an Abstract State Machine (ASM) specification of the Landing Gear System case study, and shows how the ASMETA framework can be used to support the modeling and analysis (validation and verification) activities for developing a rigorous and correct model in terms of ASMs. We exploit the two fundamental concepts of the ASM method, i.e., the notion of ground model and the refinement principle, and we achieve model development and model analysis by the combined use of formal methods for specification and for verification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Formal specifications are widely used in the development of safety critical systems, as the Sensor Voting Module of the Landing Gear System. However, the conformance relationship between the formal specification and the concrete implementation must be checked. In this paper, we show a technique to formally link a Java class with its Abstract State Machine formal specification, and two approaches for checking their conformance: an offline model-based testing approach and an online runtime monitoring approach.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A case study problem based on a set of aircraft landing gear is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state). Although tool support for Hybrid Event-B is currently lacking, the complexity of the case study provides a valuable challenge for the expressivity and modelling capabilities of the formalism. The size of the case study, and in particular, the number of overtly independent subcomponents that the problem domain contains, both significantly exercise the multi-machine and coordination capabilities of Hybrid Event-B, requiring the use of novel coordination mechanisms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper we present our formalisation of the ABZ landing gear case study in Event-B. The development was carried out using the Rodin platform and mainly used superposition refinement to structure the specification. To validate the model we complemented proof with animation and model checking. For the latter, we used the ProB animator and model checker. Graphical representation of the model turned out to be crucial in the development and validation of the model; this was achieved using a new version of BMotion Studio integrated into ProB 2.0.&lt;/p>
