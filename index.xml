This created Alloy model can then be analyzed by the Alloy Analyzer, a solver that finds concrete structures that satisfy the constraints defined in the Alloy model.
The analysis can be used to generate sample structures or to check properties of these structures by trying to generate counterexamples. Alloy is based on the Z specification language and Tarski&amp;rsquo;s relational calculus.&lt;/p>

It is based on the Z notation but slightly more low-level. In B a system consists of an abstract machine in which the modeler specifies the goal of the system. Via several refinement steps, this abstract goal is enhanced by more details on a less abstract level by adding details about data structures and algorithms that define how the goal is achieved.
All steps are proven correct until a deterministic version (the implementation) is reached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://methode-b.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://methode-b.com&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Event-B is an evolution of B with a simpler notation. Similar to B a system is modeled by different abstraction levels that are connected by a rigorous refinement proven correct. Whereas the B-method is intended to the development of correct-by-construction software, the purpose of Event-B is to model full systems (including hardware and operation environment). These two languages share almost the same mathematical language.&lt;/p>

The language aims for defining the set of all correct system behaviors. It is organized in modules that contain a definition of states and (conditional) state transitions in form of steps. A &amp;ldquo;next-state-relations&amp;rdquo; defines how variables can change in any step. Similar to Z, B, and Event-B TLA+ is based on the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, but extended with built-in temporal logic operators.&lt;/p>

Besides the internal data also external input/output data is considered in the models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The functional behavior can be either defined abstract by pre- and postconditions or explicitly by specific state-based operations. The precise mathematical semantics of these definitions allows for a wide range of analyses, e.g. static analysis, testing or proof of properties of the sytem.&lt;/p>

Z provides a standardized catalogue of often used mathematical functions and predicates.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA + in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference &amp;ldquo;ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods&amp;rdquo;, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ABZ 2024 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As successfully practiced in previous editions of ABZ, the 10th edition of ABZ will include again special sessions dedicated to a shared real-life case study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The objective of this session is to enrich the set of case studies (
&lt;a href="https://abz-conf.org/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://abz-conf.org/case-studies/&lt;/a>) developed with Rigorous State Based Methods with a practical and real-life case study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The case study proposed in this edition is the Mechanical Lung Ventilator (MLV). The MLV is intended to provide ventilation support for patients that require mechanical ventilation in two operative modes: Pressure Controlled Ventilation (PCV) and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). The former is used when patients are not able to start breathing on their own, while the latter support patients by partially taking over the work of breathing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The suggested outcomes (as reported in the specification document) are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A classical approach consists in modeling the system or part of it and applying the classical V&amp;amp;V activities, like formal verification of the correctness or validation of scenarios. One could check that the behavior of the system is correct, like in case of some types of errors, the system goes into a fail-safe mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A critical aspect of the system is its temporal behavior. Many properties and constraints have explicit temporal requirements (like after 10 seconds &amp;hellip;). One could model these aspects and make a temporal analysis of the system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After the good experience of ABZ2022, we decided to also include the GUI. Research activities could refer to modeling this critical component and analyzing the human-computer interaction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generation of executable source code and implement a prototype of the ventilator on a simple electronic board like Arduino (or part of it).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All the pdf versions of the specification document are available here (we keep track of all the changes in the documents):

&lt;p>The ABZ PhD Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to state based formal methods for software and system development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This forum is a good opportunity for PhD students to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>bring together PhD students and established and known researchers of the state based formal methods community,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enable PhD students to interact with other PhD students and to stimulate exchange of ideas suggestions and experiences among participants,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>provide PhD students an opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical atmosphere.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We seek PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete, or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted for the main conference in order to participate to the ABZ 2024 Doctoral Symposium.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="abz-2024-invites">ABZ 2024 invites:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Contribution to doctoral symposium&lt;/strong>: This is an excellent opportunity for PhD students to present their ongoing work and receive valuable feedback from the ABZ community. A paper of no more than &lt;em>4 pages (excluding references)&lt;/em> in
&lt;a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LNCS format&lt;/a> is expected and will be reviewed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Preferably, submissions should include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Title of the paper and the author name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Problem statement, motivations, and progress&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current development and related work&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Contributions are solicited on all aspects of the theory and applications of ASMs, Alloy, B, TLA, VDM, Z and other state-based rigour approaches in software/hardware engineering, including the development of tools and industrial applications. The program spans from theoretical and methodological foundations to practical applications, emphasizing system engineering methods and tools that are distinguished by mathematical rigor and have proved to be industrially viable. The main goal of the conference is to contribute to the integration of accurate state- and machine-based system development methods, clarifying their commonalities and differences to better understand how to combine different approaches for accomplishing the various tasks in modeling, experimental validation, mathematical verification of reliable high-quality hardware/software systems. Although organized to host several formal methods in a single event, editorial control of the joint conference is vested in one integrated program committee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bergamo is a small city in Lombardy, in the northern part of Italy, yet it is rich in history and culture. &lt;br>
The impressive &lt;strong>Venetian Walls&lt;/strong>, enclosing the beauties of the Upper Town for more than four centuries, are recognized as a &lt;strong>Unesco World Heritage&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>ABZ 2024 will host the two following workshops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rodin-workshop">Rodin workshop&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Event-B is a formal method for system-level modeling and analysis. The Rodin Platform is an Eclipse-based toolset for Event-B that provides effective support for modeling and automated proof. The platform is open source and is further extendable with plug-ins. A range of plug-ins have already been developed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The purpose of this workshop is to bring together existing and potential users and developers of the Rodin toolset and to foster a broader community of Rodin users and developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Rodin users, the workshop will provide an opportunity to share tool experiences and gain an understanding of ongoing tool developments. For plug-in developers, the workshop will provide an opportunity to showcase their tools and to achieve better coordination of tool development efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participants may attend or present both in person or remotely.
If you are willing to participate remotely, please contact the organizers.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="ivoire-workshop">IVOIRE workshop&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Historically, formal methods and supported environments have focused more on only one-half of the quality-assurance process: verification (are we building the software right?).
The other half, validation (are we building the right software?), has been given much less attention, i.e., we have fewer automated/push-button tools available for validation, unlike verification.
The IVOIRE workshop focuses on developing an enhanced formal paradigm based on an extension of the refinement framework that includes a comprehensive validation process and toolchain to perform validation obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for formal methods practitioners, researchers, and academics to discuss various issues associated with validation for formal methods, including but not limited to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Validation obligations or other systematic approaches to validation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Relation between refinement and validation and the interplay between verification and validation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Environments and tools to manage the validation process&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluations, benchmarking, case studies, etc.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In this article, we present an approach to the ABZ 2020 case study, that differs from the ones usually presented at ABZ: Rather than using a (correct-by-construction) approach following a formal method, we use MISRA C for a low-level implementation instead. We strictly adhere to test-driven development for validation, and only afterwards apply model checking using CBMC for verification. In consequence, our realization of the ABZ case study can serve as a baseline reference for comparison, allowing to assess the benefit provided by the various formal modeling languages, methods and tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper introduces an Event-B formal model of the adaptive exterior light system for cars, a case study proposed in the context of the ABZ2020 conference. The system describes the different provided lights and the conditions under which they are switched on/off in order to improve the visibility of the driver without dazzling the oncoming ones. The system can be viewed as a lights controller that reads different information form the available sensors (key state, exterior luminosity, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the lights in order to ensure a good visibility for the driver according to the information read. Our model is built using stepwise refinement with the Event-B method. We consider all the features of the case study, all proof obligations have been discharged using the rodin provers. Our model has been validated using ProB by applying the different provided scenarios. This validation has permitted us to point out and correct some mistakes, ambiguities and oversights in the first versions of the case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The present paper presents our proposal of an Event-B model of a speed control system, a part of the case study provided in the ABZ2020 conference. The case study describes how the system regulates the current speed of a car according to a set criteria like the speed desired by the driver, the position of a possible preceding vehicle but also a given speed limit that the driver must not exceed. For that purpose, this controller reads different information form the available sensors (key state, desired speed, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the car&amp;rsquo;s speed according to the read information. To formally model this system, we adopt a stepwise refinement approach with the Event-B method. We consider most features of the case study, all proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers. Our model has been validated using ProB by applying the different provided scenarios. This validation has permitted us to point out and correct some mistakes, ambiguities and oversights contained in the first versions of the case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the context of automotive domain, modern control systems are software-intensive and have adaptive features to provide safety and comfort. These software-based features demand software engineering approaches and formal methods that are able to guarantee correct operation, since malfunctions may cause harm/damage. Adaptive Exterior Light and the Speed Control Systems are examples of software-intensive systems that equip modern cars. We have used the Abstract State Machines to model the behaviour of both control systems. Each model has been developed through model refinement, following the incremental way in which functional requirements are given. We used the asmeta tool-set to support the simulation of the abstract models, their validation against the informal requirements, and the verification of behavioural properties. In this paper, we discuss our modelling, validation and verification strategies, and the results (in terms of features addressed and not) of our activities. In particular, we provide insights on how we addressed the adaptive features (the adaptive high beam headlights and the adaptive cruise control) by explicitly modelling their software control loops according to the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) reference control model for self-adaptive systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have modelled parts of the ABZ automotive case study using the B-method. For the early phases of modelling we have used the classical B for software, while for proof we have used Event-B and Rodin. It is maybe surprising that classical B&amp;rsquo;s machine inclusion mechanism along with operation calls can be used for modular system modelling. Moreover, for one particular style of modelling, the result can then be translated to superposition refinement with event extension in Event-B. Before conducting the proof, we have validated our models using model checking and animation with visualizations. The graphical visualizations were constructed using a new plugin (VisB) which helped uncover errors and transforms our model into an executable, interactive reference specification which can be examined by users without formal background.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper reports on the development and validation of a formal model for an automotive adaptive exterior lights system (ELS) with multiple variants in Electrum, a lightweight formal specification language that extends Alloy with mutable relations and temporal logic. We explore different strategies to address variability, one in pure Electrum and another through an annotative language extension. We then show how Electrum and its Analyzer can be used to validate systems of this nature, namely by checking that the reference scenarios are admissible, and to automatically verify whether the established requirements hold. A prototype was developed to translate the provided validation sequences into Electrum and back to further automate the validation process. The resulting ELS model was validated against the provided validation sequences and verified for most of requirements for all variants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This case study continues the successful series of case studies for formal specification and verification of the ABZ conference series, which started with the landing gear system and expanded with the hemodialysis medical device and the European Train Control System (ETCS) in the following years. This document describes two systems from the automotive domain: an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). This specification is based on the SPES XT running example. Besides their general architectures, the requirements of the software based controllers are described. Both systems are only loosely coupled, which makes it possible to handle them independently&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents an Event-B model of the ABZ2018 case study on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard. The case study focusses on the management of fixed virtual sub-sections (VSS). We model the hybrid level 3 of the standard, which assumes that trains may be either equipped with an on-board train integrity monitoring system (TIMS) and that they report their position and integrity, ERTMS trains not fitted with TIMS that report only their front position or non-ERTMS trains that do not report any information about their position. We take into account most of the main features of the case study. Our model is decomposed into four refinements. All proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers, except those related to the computation of the VSS state machine, which was found to be ambiguous (nondeterministic). Our model has been validated using ProB. The main safety property, which is that ERTMS trains do not collide, is proved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We demonstrate diagrammatic Event-B formal modelling of a hybrid, &amp;lsquo;fixed virtual block&amp;rsquo; approach to train movement control for the emerging European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) level 3. We perform a refinement-based formal development and verification of the no-collision safety requirement. The development reveals limitations in the specification and identifies assumptions on the environment. We reflect on our team-based approach to finding useful modelling abstractions and demonstrate a systematic modelling method using the UMLlike state and class diagrams of iUML-B. We suggest enhancements to the existing iUML-B method that would have benefitted this development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a specification of the hybrid ERTMS/ETCS level 3 standard in the framework of the case study proposed for the 6th edition of the ABZ conference. The specification is based on the method and tools, developed in the ANR FORMOSE project, for the modeling and formal verification of critical and complex system requirements. The requirements are specified with SysML/KAOS goal diagrams and are automatically translated into B System specifications, in order to obtain the architecture of the formal specification. Domain properties are specified by ontologies with the SysML/KAOS domain modeling language, based on OWL and PLIB. Their automatic translation completes the structural part of the formal specification. The only part of the specification, which must be manually completed, is the body of events. The construction is incremental, based on the refinement mechanisms existing within the involved methods. The formal specification of the case study is composed of seven refinement levels and all the proofs have been discharged with the Rodin prover.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Spin model checker has been successfully applied to the modelling, validation, and verification of different safety-critical systems. In this paper, we model and validate the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 Case Study using Spin; in particular, we show the assumptions we made to keep the state space limited, and present the problems and ambiguities that arose during the modelling. Although Spin offers several advantages in terms of validation and verification facilities, its modelling language Promela is limited if compared to higher level notations of other formal methods. Therefore, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the tool, and how it could be improved in terms of modelling facilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Usually, case studies dealing with train systems concentrate on the safety of trains circulating on tracks equipped with points and crossings and protected by means of traffic lights and speed limit sign postings as in [1, 2, 3]. Train drivers are supposed to follow such indications. The goal of formal approaches used in such case studies is to prove that trains may circulate safely on such tracks provided drivers act correctly. This is done by constructing models of such complex systems and by using formal proof techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this article, we present a concrete realisation of the ETCS Hybrid Level 3 concept, whose practical viability was evaluated in a field demonstration in 2017. Hybrid Level 3 (HL3) introduces Virtual SubSections (VSS) as sub-divisions of classical track sections with Trackside Train Detection (TTD). Our approach introduces an add-on for the Radio Block Centre (RBC) of Thales, called Virtual Block Function (VBF), which computes the occupation states of the VSSs according to the HL3 concept using the train position reports, train integrity information, and the TTD occupation states. From the perspective of the RBC, the VBF behaves as an Interlocking (IXL) that transmits all signal aspects for virtual signals introduced for each VSS to the RBC. We report on the development of the VBF, implemented as a formal B model executed at runtime using ProB and successfully used in a field demonstration to control real trains.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper reports on the development of a formal model for the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 concept in Electrum, a lightweight formal specification language that extends Alloy with mutable relations and temporal logic operators. We show how Electrum and its Analyzer can be used to perform scenario exploration to validate this model, namely to check that all the example operational scenarios described in the reference document are admissible, and to reason about expected safety properties, which can be easily specified and model checked for arbitrary track configurations. The Analyzer depicts scenarios (and counter-examples) in a graphical notation that is logic-agnostic, making them understandable for stakeholders without expertise in formal specification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Embedded critical systems need to be validated very thoroughly; it usually results in very long and onerous test phases.
Formal techniques, in particular formal specification languages and associated proof tools, could be an advantageous alternative, or at least a good complement and allow a significant reduction of test phases. However, for these techniques to be used in practice, one issue to consider is their efficiency and scalability on complex industrial systems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hemodialysis machine case study is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state). A broadly component based strategy is adopted, using the multi-machine and coordination facilities of Hybrid Event-B. Since, like most medical procedures, hemodialysis is under overall human control, it is largely a sequential process, with some branching to deal with exceptional circumstances. This makes for a relatively uncomplicated modelling framework, provided a model of the operator is included in order to capture the handling of exceptions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Medical devices are nowadays more and more software dependent, and software malfunctioning can lead to injuries or death for patients. Several standards have been proposed for the development and the validation of medical devices, but they establish general guidelines on the use of common software engineering activities without any indication regarding methods and techniques to assure safety and reliability. This paper takes advantage of the Hemodialysis machine case study to present a formal development process supporting most of the engineering activities required by the standards, and provides rigorous approaches for system validation and verification. The process is based on the Abstract State Machine formal method and its model refinement principle.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents the specification of the hemodialysis case study, proposed by ABZ'16 conference. The specification was carried out by a coupling of Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (ASTD) and B-like methods. astd are a graphical notation, based on automata and process algebra operators. They provide an easy-to-read specification of the dynamic behaviour of the system. The data model is specified using the Event-B language. The system is incrementally designed using extended refinement of both methods.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a formal model of aspects of the haemodialysis machine case study using the Circus specification notation. We focus on building a model in which each of the software requirements (R-1–36) are represented by a Circus action. All of these act in concert with actions that model the collection of sensor data and the progress through the various therapy phases and activities. We then present how we model check the system using FDR.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We present a formal specification of a hemodialysis machine (HD machine) using Event-B. We model the HD machine using iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams and build a corresponding BMotion Studio visualisation. We focus on validation using (i) diagrams to aid the modelling of the sequential properties of the requirements, and (ii) ProB-based animation and visualisation tools to explore the system’s behaviour. Some of the safety properties involve dynamic behaviour which is difficult to verify in Event-B. For these properties we use co-simulation tools to validate against a continuous model of the physical behaviour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This article describes the Event-B modeling of a landing gear system of an aircraft whose complete description can be found in Boniol and Wiels (The Landing Gear System Case Study, ABZ Case Study, Communications in Computer Information Science, vol 433, Springer, Berlin, 2014). This real-life case study has been proposed by the ABZ’2014 track that took place in Toulouse, the European capital of the aeronautic industry. Our modeling is based on the Parnas and Madey’s 4-Variable Model that permits to consider the different parts of a system. These parts are incrementally introduced using the Event-B refinement technique. The entire development has been carried out with the Rodin toolset. To ensure the correctness of the different components, we use several verification techniques (animation, model checking and proof) depending on the complexity and the kind of the properties to verify. Basically, prior to the proof phase that can be tedious and complex, we use the animator ANIMB and the model checker PROB that permit to discover some trivial inconsistencies. Once no error is reported, we start the proof phase by using the Atelier B and SMT provers which we installed on Rodin. We conclude the article by drawing up some key findings of and lessons learned from this experience.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this article, we present our formalization of the ABZ landing gear case study in Event-B. The development was carried out using the Rodin platform and mainly used superposition refinement to structure the specification. To validate the model, we complemented proof with animation and model checking. For the latter, we used the ProB animator and model checker. Graphical representation of the model turned out to be crucial in the development and validation of the model; this was achieved using the visualization features provided by ProB and BMotion Studio. In addition, we discuss the positive and negative aspects of the Event-B language and tools which we encountered while working on the ABZ case study.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper describes the modeling, done using the Event-B notation, of the aircraft landing gear case study that is proposed in a special track of the ABZ’2014 Conference. In the course of our development, we discovered some problems in our initial modeling approach. This has led us to propose a second approach and then a third one. Each approach is more efficient than the previous one in terms of proof obligations (roughly speaking: 2000, 1000, 500). All this will be described in this paper. We also try to go beyond this specific case study and give some thoughts about large industrial modeling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite the high level of automation, the practicability of formal verification through model-checking of large models is hindered by the combinatorial explosion problem. In this paper we apply a novel context-aware verification technique to the Landing Gear System Case Study (LGS). The idea is to express and verify requirements relative to certain environmental situations. The system environment is decomposed into several independent scenarios (contexts), which are successively composed with the system during reachability analysis. These contexts are specified using a language called CDL (Context Description Language), based on activity and message sequence diagrams. The properties to be verified are specified with observer automata and attached to specific regions in the context. This approach enables an automated context-guided decomposition of the verification into smaller problems, hence effectively reducing the state-space explosion problem. In the case of the LGS this technique enabled the fully-automated decomposition of the verification into 885 smaller model-checking problems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe our experience with modeling the landing gear system of an aircraft using the formal specification language Fiacre. Our model takes into account the behavior and timing properties of both the physical parts and the control software of this system. We use this formal model to check safety and real-time properties on the system but also to find a safe bound on the maximal time needed for all gears to be down and locked (assuming the absence of failures). Our approach ultimately relies on the model-checking tool Tina, that provides state-space generation and model-checking algorithms for an extension of Time Petri Nets with data and priorities.&lt;/p>

This real-life case study has been proposed by the ABZ’2014 track that takes place in Toulouse, the European capital of the aeronautic industry. Our modeling is based on the Parnas and Madey’s 4-Variable Model that permits to consider the different parts of a system. These parts are incremently introduced using the Event-B refinement technique. The entire development has been carried out under the Rodin toolset. To validate and prove the different components, we use the Atelier B, SMT and ML provers which are plugged to Rodin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This paper presents a stepwise formal development of the landing system of an aircraft.

&lt;p>The paper presents an Abstract State Machine (ASM) specification of the Landing Gear System case study, and shows how the ASMETA framework can be used to support the modeling and analysis (validation and verification) activities for developing a rigorous and correct model in terms of ASMs. We exploit the two fundamental concepts of the ASM method, i.e., the notion of ground model and the refinement principle, and we achieve model development and model analysis by the combined use of formal methods for specification and for verification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A case study problem based on a set of aircraft landing gear is examined in Hybrid Event-B (an extension of Event-B that includes provision for continuously varying behaviour as well as the usual discrete changes of state). Although tool support for Hybrid Event-B is currently lacking, the complexity of the case study provides a valuable challenge for the expressivity and modelling capabilities of the formalism. The size of the case study, and in particular, the number of overtly independent subcomponents that the problem domain contains, both significantly exercise the multi-machine and coordination capabilities of Hybrid Event-B, requiring the use of novel coordination mechanisms.&lt;/p>

The case study introduces a safety critical interactive system called
AMAN (Arrival MANager) which is a partly-autonomous scheduler of landing sequences of aircraft in airports. This interactive systems interleaves Air Traffic Controllers activities with automation in AMAN. While some AMAN systems are currently deployed in airports, we consider here only a subset of functions which represent a challenge in modelling and verification.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adaptive Exterior Light and Speed Control System (ABZ 2020)</title><link>/case-study/abz20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>/case-study/abz20/</guid><description>&lt;p>This document describes two systems from the automotive domain: an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). This specification is based on the SPES XT running example. Besides their general architectures, the requirements of the software based controllers are described. Both systems are only loosely coupled, which makes it possible to handle them independently&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 (ABZ 2018)</title><link>/case-study/abz18/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>/case-study/abz18/</guid><description>&lt;p>This document presents a description of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) case study. ERTMS is a system of standards for management and interoperation of signalling for railways by the European Union (EU). The case study focuses on the ERTMS Level 3 Hybrid principle, which accommodates different types of trains including ERTMS trains equiped with the Train Integrity Monitoring System (TIMS), ERTMS trains without TIMS, and non-ERTMS trains.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hemodialysis Machine (ABZ 2016)</title><link>/case-study/abz16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:33:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>/case-study/abz16/</guid><description>&lt;p>This documents presents a description of a case study concerning the control of a hemodialysis (HD) machine.
